But I would agree that it should be included that Froakie resembles some sort of frog, but despite its resemblence to tree frogs and dart frogs I think it's too early to determine that exactly.

Besides, we can never determine what the creator of the Pokemon used for inspiration, unless they explicitly tell us, so we just have to go with our best educated guess as a group. Assuming they did I halfway decent job with the design, we should be able to figure out what they were going for. Finally, I never said their wasn't a difference between frogs and toads (a primary one is toads are more land dwellers, while frogs prefer being in the water more), but, regardless, I do think Froakie is based on a frog (specifically of the tree variety), so I'm not arguing against you there. --<a href=# class=new title="User:CoolDudeAl (page does not exist)">CoolDudeAl</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:CoolDudeAl">talk</a>) 00:43, 13 January 2013 (UTC) I think the point was that it could be any frog.

These foam nests are formed from the frog's behinds and, while creating them, eventually envelop the backs of the parent frogs, hence the backpack resemblance Froakie's foam pack has and why it is located upon its back. This seems to also match up with Froakie's japanese name, as it contains matsu which translates to bubble or foam. <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>Here</a>'s an example image of a frog and its foam nest. Unfortunately, I am not quite sure which exact species of foam nest making frogs Froakie may have been based on.</p><p>Now then, onto the origin of the white round dots upon its face. These dots, coupled with the foam pouch and white glove-like markings it has seems to indicate that Froakie's possible origin is that of the image of Japanese folklore thieves and robbers, an example drawing of said thief/robber design can be seen <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>here</a>. The foam backpack of sorts upon Froakie resembles that of the thief's furoshiki, a japanese cloth bag seen on the image of said thief that they carry their loot in. The dots resemble the ends of another furoshiki tied upon the thief's nose, used as a mask of sorts to hide the thief's/robber's identities. The gloves are also simply a sort of thief/robber general stereotype as well. This seems to indicate that Froakie may posisbly end up as a dark type upon evoluton; this guessing of type, however, is just pure speculation on my part. - <a href=# title=User:050294>050294</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:050294">talk</a>) 00:23, 10 January 2013 (UTC)</p>I think he looks a bit more... professorial than that. The little blobs look more like glasses than a knot. They're not attached to anything, for a start. Plus, I don't think many thieves wear white. I reckon they're meant to resemble pince-nez. Big, white, flowing hair on the back, like a professor, or a composer, or a judge. Could be wrong, though! You might be entirely right - and it's a great spot of research either way, fun read! <a href=# class=new title="User:Constantmotion (page does not exist)">Constantmotion</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Constantmotion">talk</a>) 10:04, 10 January 2013 (UTC) Actually the dots are "connected" to the pouch via the blue stripe upon its head which lead down its back. This I feel, for this specific Japanese robber image, is pretty fitting considering the openness of their furoshiki masks and perhaps the one stripe being the only connector may have simply been implemented just to emphasize this trait. Also, I wouldn't take color into origin consideration. Pokemon don't necessarily have to be matching the origin with color. Sometimes with specific references, like in delibird's case, correct colors are vital. However, most Pokemon are either colored in bright, odd colors or ones that match with it's typing: Froakie being blue not because of the thief origin but rather because of it's water typing, like how Heatmor is bright red like fire instead of normal anteater colors. Also, thank you for the compliment! I really enjoy analyzing things. So origins, or at least their speculations and research, are my specialty! - <a href=# title=User:050294>050294</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:050294">talk</a>) 14:28, 10 January 2013 (UTC) I think that stripe is just decoration, and Froakie is based off of Ben Franklin or another scientist. <a href=# class=new title="User:Dralcax (page does not exist)">(O++O) Dralcax</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Dralcax">talk</a>) 18:58, 12 January 2013 (UTC) How does it resemble Ben Franklin or scientists at all? For one thing not all have white hair and the second thing is that the white extensions are based upon foam, not hair. With this same insane logic, one could say Swablu and Altaria somehow resemble scientists as well because of their fluffy white bodies, and that's just insane. Sorry, but unless an evolution's name has a scientist in it or any bit of scientist design inspiration than this origin claim is just incredibly ludicrous. - <a href=# title=User:050294>050294</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:050294">talk</a>) 19:09, 12 January 2013 (UTC) It's too early to know what else Froakie was based on (besides a frog), I think his evolutions will help us figure it out, but so far I've seen everything from a burglar to a prince, and from a scientist to an aristocrat, and I don't think debating it will help, because at this point I can see where all of these are coming from, and without further information (like his evolutions), we aren't going to come to a conclusive answer. --<a href=# class=new title="User:CoolDudeAl (page does not exist)">CoolDudeAl</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:CoolDudeAl">talk</a>) 00:50, 13 January 2013 (UTC) I believe the picture that resembles Froakie so much must be <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>this one</a>, given the glasses, hair and cravat represented by the foam.

Taking into account the species actions in anime and the game so far, this reference is more than likely deliberate. Froakie has been shown to retract its bubble "pack" and using it very similarly to the aforementioned thieves. <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>This screenshot</a>, for example, shows froakie retracting its chest bubbles and using both it, and the ones on its back, and placing them upon its face, acting as a pretty obvious reference to a thief's furoshiki bag. - <a href=# title=User:050294>050294</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:050294">talk</a>) 08:53, 27 October 2013 (UTC)</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Ability>Ability</span></h2><p>If the gender rate is already put in as the norm for all starters, shouldn't the ability (torrent) be put in too? - <i>unsigned comment from <a href=# class=new title="User:Thesimplelife12345 (page does not exist)">Thesimplelife12345</a> (<a href=# class=new title="User talk:Thesimplelife12345 (page does not exist)">talk</a> • <a href=# title=Special:Contributions/Thesimplelife12345>contribs</a>)</i></p>The gender rate is just there because there HAS to be a gender ratio, otherwise the template breaks.

I know lick isn't a very decisive attack, since alot of pokémon can learn it, but the only other move that might show his typing is Round, which would mean the evolutions would be dual Water/Normal type.
