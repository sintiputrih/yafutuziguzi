Cranston, of course, is known for playing the role of Walter White on the TV series, Breaking Bad, which is hailed as one of the best series of all time. While Dearden’s career in the entertainment industry is nothing to sneer at, Bryan’s career far outweighs her own. The pair have been together for around 30 years and had their moments of trouble. But despite everything, Bryan and Robin stuck together for nearly three decades, something which is rare in Hollywood today. In this article, we take a closer look at the biography of Robin Dearden.</p><p><strong>Robin Dearden is an American&nbsp;actress</strong> <strong>and wife of Bryan Cranston</strong>. <strong>She has a combined <strong>net worth</strong></strong> <strong><strong>of $50 Million</strong> with her actor husband. On the physical side of things, Robin has brown eyes, brown hair, and a body build of the ectomorph type. Her zodiac is Sagittarius.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Bryan-Cranston-wife-Robin-Dearden.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life:</h2><p>Robin Gale Dearden was born on the 4th of December 1953, in Los Angeles, California. Born and raised in LA, not much is known about Robin and the actress has been quiet about the details. Details on her parents, education, and early life have never been revealed to the media and are sure to stay as so.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Professional Career:</h2><p>While Robin has never really come out to talk about her early interest in acting, it might be safe to say that her interest in acting was something she discovered during her early years. She made her debut on the 1974 TV show, Happy Days. She also played a small role in the 1976’s TV show, Family before going on to star in The Kroft Supershow. 1977 saw Robin cast in the TV movie, Bigfoot and Wildboy. Her first blockbuster appearance came in the 1978 version of the movie, The Incredible Hulk.</p><p>Over the years Robin has been cast in a variety of roles in both movies and TV series. Some of her appearances include David Cassidy: Man Undercover (1978), B.J. and the Bear (1979), Trouble in High Timber Country (1980), Love Sydney (1981), Knight Rider (1982), Airwolf (1984), Outlaws (1986), The New Adam-12 (1990), Thirst (1998), Last Chance (1999), The Shrink is In (2001), Myron’s Movie (2004), Illusion (2004), and more recently on Chicanery (2017).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bryan, Marriage, and other things:</h2><p>Robin and Bryan first met on the set of the TV series, Airwolf. In the 1986 episode, Bryan’s character held a gun to Robin’s head. And while their on-set relationship was nothing to get jealous of, the duo shared amazing chemistry off-screen. Even though they both were not huge fans of the series, they regularly flirted with each other off-screen.</p><p>Despite an instant connection, both Bryan and Robin had partners at the time and could not take the next step. The pair parted ways at the time and as Bryan puts it, had they not, things would not have worked out as well.<br>The pair got back together a year later and began dating. After dating for a few years, Bryan wanted to propose but couldn’t think of a way to get back his nervousness. So he tied the ring on his baby toe and invited Robin to take a bath with him. Crammed in the bath, Bryan began his speech by telling how much he loved Robin. However, he kept trying to push her head back in hopes that she would see the ring. When she didn’t, Bryan simply said, “Here’s your ring, but I can’t reach it. Take the ring off my toe.” The pair tied the knot on the 8th of July, 1989, and have been together ever since.</p><p>In their 33 years as a married couple, the pair have a single daughter, Taylor Dearden who was born on 12th February 1993. Like her parents, Tyler is an actor who is trying to find her way in the industry.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sex in the train:</h2><p>When Bryan appeared on ‘Conan’ he had a hilarious story to tell about his 28th anniversary. Bryan and Robin were caught having sex on the train. To be fair to them, the travel agent had told them that the tunnel was 50 minutes long and it was customary for couples to make use of it.</p><p>“We’re reclining, going, and we’re enjoying our love making. Within a short period of time, I start seeing the features of my beautiful wife’s face, and I’m thinking my eyes are getting acclimated to this… Within seconds, WHAM, we’re out in broad daylight. And my gorgeous wife says to me those three words you always want to hear, ‘Get off me'”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A quick write on her husband-Bryan Cranston:</h2><p>Bryan Cranston is an American actor, producer, director, and screenwriter.
