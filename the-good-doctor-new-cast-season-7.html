(One MD has an unexpected connection with Shaun!)</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The Good Doctor</a> is ABC’s medical drama following Shaun Murphy, a young autistic surgeon from the small city of Casper, Wyoming, who relocates to San Jose, California, to work at the prestigious San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital. ABC announced in January 2024 that The Good Doctor, which premiered in 2017, would end with its seventh and final season premiering on February 20, 2024.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Playing Dr. Shaun Murphy has been an immense privilege and one of the most remarkable and rewarding experiences of my life,” Freddie Highmore, who plays Shaun and is also an executive producer on the series, said in a statement at the time. “I will always be grateful to David, Liz, and Erin as well as the hugely talented — and lovely — cast, writers, and crew who made this show possible. Caring deeply is what got us here. Thank you to Sony and ABC, and to everyone who has watched along at home. With love from Vancouver … tequila, stat!”</p><p>News of The Good Doctor‘s cancellation also came after the exit of two cast members: Hill Harper, who played Dr. Marcus Andrews from Seasons 1 to 6, and Brandon Larracuente, who played Dr. Daniel “Danny” Perez, in Season 6. Harper, who was one of the few remaining original cast members on The Good Doctor, left the series to focus on his run for the United States Senate.</p><p>“Hill Harper feels strongly that there is a crisis in American democracy — too often, government only works for the rich and powerful while the rest of us struggle to find a voice,” a representative for Harper told <a href=# rel=noopener>TV Line</a> in November 2023. “Hill is dedicating his efforts full time to fixing that, and he’s running for the U.S. Senate as an active union member to give working people more of a voice in Congress.”</p><p>So who are the <a href=# rel=noopener>new Good Doctor cast members</a> replacing Harper and Larracuente in Season 7? Read on for what we know about the <a href=# rel=noopener>new Good Doctor cast for Season 7</a> and the doctors joining Bonaventure for the series’ final season.</p><h2>Who are the new Good Doctor cast members for Season 7?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Good-Doctor-New-Cast.png alt="The Good Doctor New Cast" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Who are the new Good Doctor cast members for Season 7? The Good Doctor Season 7 includes two new cast members: Kayla Cromer and Wavyy Jonez. Both Cromer and Jonez play recurring characters in The Good Doctor‘s final season.</p><p>Cromer plays Charlene “Charlie” Lukaitis, a third-year medical student who’s excited for a chance to work with Dr. Shaun Murphy. Like Shaun, Charlie is also autistic. “Like Shaun, she has Autism Spectrum Disorder, and she has idolized him since she first saw the viral video of him saving a boy’s life at the San Jose airport. Empowered and energetic, her passion for surgery may only be matched by her love for Taylor Swift,” Charlie’s official character description reads, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>TV Line</a>.</p><p>Jonez plays Dominick “Dom” Hubank, another third-year medical student who is described as “a gentle giant who was hoping this surgical rotation was just a box to check on his way to become the family doctor in his underserved community. But this former football player learns he isn’t as tough as he appears when he faints at the sight of blood. Too big to fail, Dom must overcome his newly discovered hemophobia, and will need his peer and friend Charlie to do so.”</p><p>Both Dom and Charlie will debut in The Good Doctor Season 7, Episode 2, “Skin in the Game,” which was written by Garrett Lerner and Natalie Touboul and directed by Freddie Highmore, who plays Shaun.</p><p>Like Charlie, Cromer is also autistic. Before The Good Doctor, she starred on the Freeform’s Everything’s Gonna Be Okay where her character Matilda was also on the autism spectrum. She also voiced Twyla, the autistic daughter of the Boogeyman, on Nickelodeon’s animated series Monster High. Jonez, for his part, previously portrayed Biggie Smalls in the USA Network series Unsolved: The Murders of Tupac and the Notorious B.I.G.. He also starred in shows like Dickinson, Reprisal, Wu-Tang: An American Saga, and Young Rock.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with Kromer and Jonez, The Good Doctor Season 7 cast also includes returning cast members Freddie Highmore (Dr. Shaun Murphy); Richard Schiff (Dr. Aaron Glassman); Fiona Fubelmann (Dr. Morgan Reznick); Will Yun Lee (Dr. Alex Park); Christina Chang (Dr. Audrey Lim); Paige Spara (Lea Dilallo); Bria Samone Henderson (Dr. Jordan Allen); Noah Galvin (Dr. Asher Wolke); and Chuku Modu (Jared Kalu.)</p><p>The Good Doctor is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hulu</a>.</p><p><strong>For more on The Good Doctor, check out our gallery below on <a href=# rel=noopener>who the cast is married to and dating in real life.</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvYWmGcXyOrZ%2BeZZekvKV5w6iaraeiYrumw4ycmKysXaiyor%2FOp2RwZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./actress-mimi-orjiekwe-receives-a-brand-new-lexus-suv-for-her-birthday.html>&#171;&nbsp;Actress Mimi Orjiekwe Receives A Brand New Lexus SUV For Her Birthday</a>
