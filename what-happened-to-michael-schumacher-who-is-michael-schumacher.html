career.</strong></p><p>The fastest-ever car driver lost consciousness after falling while skiing in the Alps in 2013 and suffering near-fatal injuries. Following his injuries, the doctors placed him in a medically induced coma, which lasted for 250 days before he was allowed to return home.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Happened to Michael Schumacher?</h2><p>After suffering a serious skiing accident in 2013, the renowned Formula One racer Michael Schumacher had to deal with a tragic turn of events.

Corinna, Schumacher’s wife, has been guarded and reticent about her husband’s health ever since.</p><p>Ralf Schumacher, Schumacher’s brother, said in a recent statement that while life can be unfair at times, acceptance is sometimes necessary.
