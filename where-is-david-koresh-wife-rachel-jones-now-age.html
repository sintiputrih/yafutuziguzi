Read the full article to learn about her. David Koresh was very contentious, and his acts drew harsh criticism. In addition to preaching that he was a messiah sent by God to save his followers, he was well-recognized for his extreme political views.</strong></p><p>After a struggle for control with the sect’s former head, George Roden, he took over as its leader in 1987.</p><p>Koresh’s leadership style was marked by a rigid hierarchy and his insistence on total subservience to his followers.</p><p>David had a relatively unique employment history prior to joining the Branch Davidians. He was a musician who performed with a band on the guitar.</p><p>He soon stopped playing music, though, and devoted himself entirely to his studies of religion. In 1984, he joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church and, three years later, the Branch Davidian sect.</p><p>Koresh remains prominent in American religious history despite his aggressive and frequently polarizing behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>Many books, documentaries, and movies about the Waco siege and its aftermath have been produced, still eliciting controversy and discussion.</p><p>Read more: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Bunnie XO Before Plastic Surgery Pics, Age Kids And Husband Revealed</a></p><h2>Where is David Koresh Wife Rachel Jones Now?</h2><p>Following the Waco siege, Rachel Jones was catapulted into the spotlight, and everything she did was closely watched.&nbsp;</p><p>Several questions about her involvement in the events that occurred at the Branch Davidian complex, and she was accused of being a brainwashed David Koresh follower.</p><p>Despite this heavy scrutiny, Rachel maintained a low profile and has generally avoided the spotlight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/David-Koresh-Wife-and-Children.webp><p>The stress Rachel went through during the siege is evident in her choice to change her name after the disaster.</p><p>She was one of the few survivors, and it must have been horrible to lose her husband and so many of her friends and fellow followers.</p><p>It makes sense for her to want to put her past behind her and try to move on with her life.</p><p>Despite the fact that Rachel Jones mostly disappeared from public view since the Waco siege, her tale is still a terrible and interesting part of American history.</p><p>The memory of David Koresh and the Branch Davidians endures, and the events of those 51 days are still hotly contested.</p><h2>Age and Family of Rachel Jones</h2><p>Houston, Texas, was the place Rachel was born on April 17, 1961. She was raised in a devout household, and her mother introduced her to the Branch Davidians.</p><p>When Rachel was just 14 years old, she started dating Koresh. She later had numerous kids with Koresh, one of whom was a girl who was born throughout the Waco siege.</p><p>All of Rachel’s children, who were all born within the Branch Davidian sect, are now adults and have left the cult and begun their own lives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Capture-2.jpg><p>As of 2023, Jones is 62 years old. It is not known if she has stayed in touch with her children or if they’re even related to one another.</p><p>They may have chosen to maintain their distance and continue on with their lives individually, considering the horrible experiences they shared.</p><p>The public is nevertheless fascinated by Rachel’s narrative. It uses it as a cautionary tale about the perils of extremism and following a charismatic leader despite the uncertainties surrounding her current condition.</p><h3>Rachel Jones’ Involvement in the Branch Davidian Cult</h3><p>One of the famous followers of the Branch Davidian cult, Raches was renowned for her fervent devotion to David.</p><p>She was not just his wife but also a devoted pupil who adhered to his principle. The cult was notorious for its radical ideologies and methods. That ultimately resulted in a violent conflict with the authorities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/david-koresh-OG.jpg><p>Jones was one of the few survivors of the 51-day siege at the Waco facility. She was expecting at the time, and during the siege, her daughter was eventually born within the enclosure.</p><p>During the raid, Rachel received a lot of backlash for her membership in the cult, and many even questioned whether she was still committed to Koresh.</p><p>Read more: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Brooklinn Khoury Dog Attack – Was It An Accident?
