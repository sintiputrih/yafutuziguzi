Deer will come out in the morning during 6:00 am to 10:00 am. During this period, the deer return from their feeding areas to their bedding areas.

I can usually sit for about 3 hours on a morning hunt and about 2 hours on an afternoon hunt. I rarely see a deer on an afternoon hunt until about a half hour before dark or right at dark, so the morning hunts are just more fun. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on midwestwhitetail.com</a><h2>Can deer smell you in a deer stand?</h2>*While the scent control basics will significantly reduce the risk of leaving any scent left behind while you enter or exit your treestands, it is the location of your treestand that insures that a wise old mature whitetail will rarely if every, smell you. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on whitetailhabitatsolutions.com</a><h2>Is it bad to hunt the same stand every day?</h2>Overhunting a stand can lead to a buck pattering you as easily as you can pattern it.
