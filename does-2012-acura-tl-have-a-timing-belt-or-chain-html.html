These cars include the Acura RL, TL, TSX (only available in V6 variant), MDX, and ZDX, among others. Even if an Acura vehicle equipped with a timing chain does not have a service period that necessitates the replacement of the timing chain, the chain might nonetheless fail.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>In addition to the information provided above, how much does it cost to repair a timing belt on an Acura TL?</h3><p>The typical cost of replacing the timing belt on an Acura TL is between $778 and $901 dollars.
