Every year on May 2nd, he celebrates his birthday<strong>. He is 22 years old right now and was born under the sign of Taurus.</strong> Many people genuinely want to know his secret to success.</p><p><strong>As a model, this star stands 5 feet 11 inches tall, which translates to 180 cm.</strong> Because he spends so much of his time in front of the camera, Noen is always in good shape. He also has a lanky and slim body. Unfortunately, his weight, dress size, and shoe size are still unknown.</p><p>Furthermore, Eubanks is mostly seen wearing an oversized black hoodie, which is unmistakably Gen Z. He enjoys dying his hair in a variety of colors. Noen’s style was normal initially, but as soon as he started his Tik Tok video, he tried some fancy moves.</p><p>Later, this American TikToker preferred his gothic to be more akin to anime characters. Going outside looking like that was a challenge for him, but as the day progressed, he felt more confident in himself. As a result, a new Noen style was born. Furthermore, this handsome enjoys playing with his hair, which he dyes in a variety of colors, including blue, blonde, red, pink, and others.</p><p>This tall model is undeniably attractive. His high cheekbones, pale skin, pouty lips, and floppy hair resemble the look of a classic Hedi Slimane male model.<br>To summarize his appearance, Noen has icy blue eyes that complete his look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Noen1.jpg><h2>Noen Eubanks Education And Childhood</h2><p>His real name is Noen Eubanks, and he grew up in Loganville, Georgia, in the United States of America. When he was a kid, he used to travel a lot from Hawaii to Georgia. He didn’t have to move around a lot after his parents divorced.</p><p>Soon after, this TikToker’s mother remarried, and Eubanks had a bad memory of that. In terms of education, this lovely model attended Loganville High School and graduated in 2019. Eubanks is also of white ethnicity and is of American nationality.</p><h2>Noen Eubanks Professional Life</h2><p>Initially, this 5’11” tall model joined YouTube and launched its own channel in 2013. He’s posted a hilarious video there. However, he rose to prominence through Musical.ly. It is the original and most popular version of Tik Tok.</p><p>It all started when Eubanks downloaded the app and recorded a video to send to his brother. He deleted the app after completing his first objective. The app had been on the market for two months at the time.</p><p>His video quickly went viral, with over 100 people watching it. People were still mentioning him. That was the point at which Noen had an epiphany. He believed he could do it and began uploading numerous videos.</p><p>According to Eubanks, he uploaded funny videos that were not funny. Everything changed on January 2nd when he did something he had never done before. It drew a large number of viewers and received a lot of positive feedback.</p><p>This 19-year-old model reasoned that if he wanted to reach a certain milestone, he should do it. It was also the first non-ironic video he had posted. No, he wasn’t joking; Noen posted a short video of himself being himself. Despite this, he removed the video after an hour. People adored it and had a great time with it.</p><p>Nonetheless, Noen was a good fit for the role and became the brand’s face. Hedi eventually photographed this hottie. He nailed the classic Slimane look that time. To sum up the look, Eubanks wore an iconic black and white cloth, a leather jacket on top, and a cropped T-shirt.</p><h2>Noen Eubanks Relationship Status</h2><p>First and foremost, Noen is of the straight gender. He is not gay, bisexual, or of any other gender, as has been speculated. Many people believe he is gay based on his Tik Tok video. Not only that but wearing make-up and painting your nails does not make you gay.</p><p>There is no doubt that Noen is adorable, cute, and hot, and anyone would want to be his girl. However, she is the only one in the world. For the past few years, this hottie has kept his girlfriend private from the media.</p><p>In an interview with The Face magazine, Eubanks jokes about making an official announcement someday about his girlfriend. Despite this, he wants fans to know that he cares about them in some way.</p><p>Noen appears to be in a romantic relationship with fellow TikToker Abby Roberts. Not to mention that she uploads make-up tutorial videos to the app. Her fans now number more than six million and are growing by the day.</p><p>Furthermore, the couple has yet to confirm their relationship in the media. Whatever the case may be, Noen and Abby are enjoying their publicity and creating new Tik Tok videos on a daily basis.</p><h2>Noen Eubanks Net Worth 2023</h2><p>There is no denying that this Tik Toker earns a lot of money from his job. As of November 2023<strong>, Noen Eubanks’s had a tidy net worth of $700k.</strong> Keeping his work in an account is a lot of money, and it’s likely to rise any day now.</p><p>Similarly, this American model is currently working at Kyra TV, and he claims that Eubank’s salary is close to 42 years old. In addition, this fantastic persona launched his entertainment company in July of last year.</p><p>The brand is called the Not Noen line, and it focuses more on the streetwear series PAQ and the fashion and beauty-themed show NAVYA. Furthermore, there is no reliable information about his exact salary, cars, or mansions. The information will be updated as soon as it is available in the media.
