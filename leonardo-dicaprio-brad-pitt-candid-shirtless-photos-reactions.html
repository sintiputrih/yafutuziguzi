We've seen contrasts in the past, with <a href=#>fans praising Keanu Reeves while bashing Tom Cruise</a>. Fans got to see something similar with <strong><a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Brad Pitt</a></strong>.</p><p>In the following, we are going to take a closer look at why Leonardo DiCaprio faced so much negativity for his vacation photos last year. What didn't help his cause was the use of a yacht. This from somebody who is concerned about the climate.</p><p>On the flip side, it was a completely different reaction to Pitt and his vacation pics from last year. We will take a closer look at what the fans had to say, and how <strong><a href=#>Quentin Tarantino</a></strong> reacted to a shirtless Brad Pitt moment in the past.

Perhaps those are major reasons as to why fans went after Leonardo DiCaprio and his shirtless photos last June. Leo was enjoying some vacation time on the Italian coast with a stunning private yacht. It was family time for Leo, as he was joined by his father, stepmom and niece. <strong>Page Six called his physique "sun-kissed," while other fans were as positive. Given his wealth, fans went after DiCaprio for not keeping in shape.</strong></p><p><strong>Fans chimed in, and the most liked comments were mostly negative:</strong></p><ul><li>"He can’t afford a personal trainer, or a gym with amenities, a pool, et cetera? Seems like he could stand a physical workout somewhere in these photos."</li><li>"Nothing says environmentalist quite like a yacht. Well, maybe the Gulfstream he takes to get there."</li><li>"There is no excuse for Leo (With all of his resources) to look so sloppy and unattractive. Just because he is middle aged does not mean it's time to give up on his appearance - See Ryan Reynolds, Dwayne Johnson, Hugh Jackman, Will Smith, etc..."</li><li>"He's 6 feet tall and weighs 192 pounds? He needs to take off 25 pounds. I could tell him exactly how to do it between the 4th of July and Thanksgiving, using 100-year-old science, but I'm afraid he'd need to a) pay me, and b) lay off the alcohol for the duration. All of this is simple stuff, but he's too lazy and arrogant to do what he needs to do."</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not the best reception, and fans weren't thrilled about his yacht either, given his stance on climate change.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/your-paragraph-text-2024-06-27t112500-008.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Fans Think Brad Pitt Gave A Strange Response When Asked About His Daughter ">Fans Think Brad Pitt Gave A Strange Response When Asked About His Daughter</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Brad Pitt kept things brief with a three word response when asked about his daughter, Zahara.</p><p>Leo's look has certainly evolved over the years. <strong>The actor looked completely different back in 2014 during a New Year's trip in St. Barth</strong>.

Yet, the actor continues to age backwards, and fans have clearly noticed. Last year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Pitt's Cabo photos went viral</a>, alongside a topless Ines de Ramon. <strong>The romantic getaway showed Brad Pitt's physique, and fans were blown away at how lean the actor remains at the age of 60.</strong></p><p><strong>Fans wrote:</strong></p><ul><li>"Lean, with enough muscle to not be skinny.

I go, ‘So, I’m thinking maybe you unbutton the Hawaiian shirt, and you peel that off, and then peel off the Champion T-shirt.’ He was like, ‘Really? You want me to go through all that button bull****? I’ll just take it off in one bit. Go!'”</li><li>“I’m like, okay, this guy knows exactly what time it is.
