Her sudden rise is in part due to her being the adopted sister of YouTube megastar JMX.

Many guys have fallen for her beauty but she has not shared if she is in a relationship or not. As a social media star, she had to go through some rumors and controversies.</p><p>It was rumored that she slept with Deji and then subsequently with Miniminter (Simon Edward Minter)- Deji used this as a diss in one of the diss tracks he made, saying Simon “got his sloppy seconds”. After numerous reaction videos from Vikkstar123(Vikram Singh Barn), Deji, and Kirsty herself, it became apparent she had slept with both of them. This has led to rumors that she was “passed around” The Sideman – which would be a bit of a scandal if true as at the time she would have only just turned 18.</p><p>She had a joke about how Miniminter was her YouTube boyfriend, which is now ironic as it has since been proven they slept together. Kirsty has also provided banter in her videos with her brother, Joel that she and TheBurntChip (Josh Larkin) were interested in each other and some comedic skits have been created from this.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements>Body Measurements</span></h2><p>Kirsty has an amazing personality. She has a curvy body. She has not disclosed the details regarding her body measurements like <strong>height,</strong> weight, chest-waist-hip, shoe size, dress size, etc. Moreover, she has blonde hair and brown eyes.
