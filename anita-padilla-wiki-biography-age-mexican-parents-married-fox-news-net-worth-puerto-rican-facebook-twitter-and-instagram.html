It’s not coming,” Nicole wrote on her&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;page. “I wear this dress probably once a month. No one has EVER had a problem with it. Wear it almost 8 months pregnant?? Whoa . . . disgusting, right? (insert massive eye roll).”</p><p>The post featured pictures of Nicole wearing the same dress three times this year, including once this week.</p><p>Nicole’s reply prompted hundreds of supportive comments and more than 1,800 “likes” on Facebook. It also led to a story on&nbsp;Yahoo! Style,&nbsp;headlined: “Pregnant newscaster responds to viewers offended by her tight dress: ‘Use your time better.’ ”</p><p>Fox 32 seemed eager to draw even more attention to the matter, posting on&nbsp;Facebook:&nbsp;“Body shaming continues to be rampant on social media and it doesn’t matter who you are or what you look like, you too can become a target. Fox 32’s Kristen Nicole, a mom of one and expecting another, was recently on the receiving end of nasty comments. The focus, over her pregnancy.”</p><p>On Thursday morning, Nicole was&nbsp;interviewed&nbsp;on set by “Good Day Chicago” colleagues Corey McPherrin and Anita Padilla about how her “body shaming experience” had become a big issue.</p><p>“I just hope that maybe some other woman who’s going through this as well sees there are people that are supporting you, and this is not the 1960s where you needed to hide or be ashamed of your pregnancy,” Nicole said. “I appreciate so many people laughing with me, and their continued support and encouragement.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=anita-padilla-awards></span>Anita Padilla Awards<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She has also received several awards:</p><ul><li>Federal Gov.t Combined Law Enforcement Community Service Award</li><li>AP Best Feature 2nd Place</li><li>Emmy awards &nbsp;1995 and 2000</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=anita-padilla-facebook></span>Anita Padilla FaceBook<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=anita-padilla-twitter></span>Anita Padilla Twitter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=anita-padilla-instagram></span>Anita Padilla Instagram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmensGiec%2Bam6KknJZ6uLXKomSboZ%2Bcv6K8x7Jkmp%2BVYrqmxMicmKdloJa%2FprrTrGSmmaKntqawjJ%2BmsWWemsS0ec2eq2avn6fBqXnPrpyrrJ9iv6qvwKdkn5mTmq%2Bwu8pmq7ChpKmys3nAp5tmoZ6owaKz0ZqkaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./is-zach-wilson-married.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is Zach Wilson Married, Girlfriend</a>
