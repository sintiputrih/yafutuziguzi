The politician is also a Member of Parliament for Varanasi. In 1975, Modi went into hiding during a state of emergency imposed across the country.</p><p>Besides being a remarkable politician, Modi is also an author. He published a Gujarati book, Jyotipunj, in the year 2008. This book contains profiles of various RSS leaders. The Prime Minister has also authored 8 other books. Most of his books contain short stories for children.</p><p>On 31 August 2012, Modi became the 1st Indian politician to interact with citizens on a live chat via Google Hangouts. Likewise, Narendra&nbsp;is also a member of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bharatiya Janata Party </a>(BJP). Subsequently, Modi is also a member of the party’s National Democratic Alliance (NDA).</p><p>Further, Modi is a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). RSS is a Hindu nationalist volunteer organization. Modi had his introduction to the RSS at the young age of 8 years. After returning to Gujarat in 1971 after his travel around the country, Modi became a full-time worker for this organization. The RSS then assigned Modi to the BJP in 1985.</p><p>In addition, there is also a stadium, Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, India.

The 1st Indian PM to hold this record was Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Moreover, Modi is also the 1st Indian PM from outside the Congress to win both terms with a majority in the Lok Sabha.</p><p>Similarly, Narendra&nbsp;was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001. Later on, he was elected to the legislative assembly as well. People have criticized Modi’s administration for failing to significantly improve health, poverty, and education.</p><p>The current Indian PM led the BJP in the 2014 general election. This gave the party a majority in the Indian lower house of parliament. His administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy. Modi’s administration has also reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programs.</p><p>Furthermore, the current PM has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy. Modi abolished the Planning Commission and hence centralized power. Modi began a high-profile sanitation campaign. Narendra also initiated a controversial demonetization of high-denomination banknotes. He eventually weakened or abolished environmental and labor laws.</p><p>Under Prime Minister Modi’s tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding. Modi’s administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir after his party’s victory in the 2019 general election. Moreover, his administration introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act. This resulted in widespread protests across the country.</p><p>Additionally, Modi has become a controversial figure both domestically and internationally. It is due to the prime minister’s Hindu nationalist beliefs.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-135664 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Narendra-Modi-receiving-the-Goalkeepers-Global-Goals-Award-from-Bill-Gates.jpeg alt="Narendra modi" width=650 height=510 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-135664 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Narendra Modi receiving the Goalkeepers Global Goals Award from Bill Gates.

So far, the PM’s channel has over 1.3 billion views and 8.83 million subscribers on his channel. Likewise, the Prime Minister has over 46.6 million people following his journey on Facebook. Moving on, Modi has a <strong>net worth</strong> estimation of around ₹ 2.85 Crore or nearly $400,000 US dollars as of 2022. However, his salary as a PM is currently unavailable. Talking about his brand endorsements, he hasnt endorsed any brands or products. Being a rising star, it is sure that we can see him as the brand ambassador of several top brands very soon.</p><h2><span id=Narendra_Modi_8211_Relationship_Status>Narendra Modi – Relationship Status</span></h2><p>Modi’s marriage was arranged by his parents at a very young age as per Ghanchi tradition. Modi was engaged at age 13 and married at 18 years of age to Jashodaben Modi. Back then, Jashodaben was only 17 years old at the time of their marriage in 1968. The married couple, reportedly, never consummated their marriage and kept it a secret. Had Modi not kept it a secret, he couldn’t have become a ‘pracharak’ in the puritan Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).</p><p>The couple spent very little time together. Soon after their marriage, Narendra went for two years of travel. This also included visits to Hindu ashrams. Narendra kept his marriage secret for most of his career. The Prime Minister acknowledged his wife for the 1st time in 2014. It was when Modi filed his nomination for the general elections that year.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-135673 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Narendra-Modi-in-a-photo-during-his-marriage.jpg alt="Narendra Modi " width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-135673 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Narendra Modi in a photo during his marriage.
