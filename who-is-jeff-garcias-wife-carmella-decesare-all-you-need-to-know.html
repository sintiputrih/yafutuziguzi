groups: those who have not achieved anything of major importance and have passed into obscurity after retirement and those who have remained relevant for many years after their achievements remarkable have rarely been remembered.&nbsp;Of course, Jeff Garcia belongs in the bottom league.</span></p><p><span>The American and Canadian football quarterback on February 24, 1970, his career spanned nearly two decades.&nbsp;Starting with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League (CFL) in 1994, Jeff then joined the 49ers of the American National Football League (NFL) in San Francisco in 1999. He left the 49ers after the 2003 season of the NFL and had a brief stint in Cleveland.&nbsp;Browns, Detroit Lions and Philadelphia Eagles between 2004 and 2006. The following year, the quarterback joined the Tampa Bay Buccanneers where he spent the 2007 and 2008 NLF seasons before playing another brief stint with the Oakland Raiders, Eagles , Omaha Nighthawks and Houston Texans;&nbsp;it was between 2009 and 2011.</span></p><p><span>Check the records, you will find that this California-born star has several outstanding performances that set him apart from many of his types.&nbsp;Along with being one of only ten quarterback players who have completed thirty touchdown touchdown passes in NFL history, Jeff has recorded 4 Pro Bowl appearances;&nbsp;consecutively from 2000 to 2002 and again in 2007. He has more than his career achievements but that would be a tale for another day.&nbsp;Let’s talk about his wife Carmella Decesare, here’s what you need to know about her.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who is Jeff Garcia’s wife, Carmella Decesare?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Carmella Decesare, wife of Jeff Garcia, is famous just like the former football quarterback and for several reasons.&nbsp;For most people, it is common knowledge that Jeff is married to a woman who made a name for herself in the famous lifestyle and entertainment magazine Playboy.&nbsp;It’s no secret that Carmella was named to American Men magazine when she took the throne of Playmate of the Year in 2004. The year before (2003), she had taken the lead.&nbsp;emerged from Miss April magazine.</span></p><p><span>The American model born as Carmella DanielleDeCesare Garcia in Avon Lake, Ohio on July 1, 1982, is of mixed heritage.&nbsp;Puerto Rican and Italian.&nbsp;Beyond her charm with Playboy, she gained attention when she entered the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) diva search contest.&nbsp;Also, after her appearance in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Player Wives episode, people must have identified with her more.</span></p><h2><strong><span>all you need to know</span></strong></h2><ul><li><strong><span>When did they become life partners?</span></strong></li></ul><p><span>Although it has been difficult to establish exactly when Jeff Garcia and Carmella Decesare became lovers, some documents show that the marriage between Jeff and Carmella began on April 21, 2007. The two men were reunited in San Martin, California , at the CordeValle Resort.</span></p><ul><li><strong><span>Do they have children?</span></strong></li></ul><p><span>Yes, they do.&nbsp;In their marriage that survived over a decade, both children were blessed with four children.&nbsp;two sons and two daughters.&nbsp;It was about a year after their union that they welcomed their first child, a daughter they named Presley;&nbsp;she was born on April 28, 2008. In June of the following year, they had their second child and first son.&nbsp;His name is Jason.&nbsp;After Jason, they had their second son, Jax.&nbsp;He was born on September 21, 2010. Their second daughter followed Jax the following year (2010).&nbsp;She was born in December and her name is Faith.</span></p><ul><li><strong><span>What they have in common</span></strong></li></ul><p><span>Aside from the kids, and of course, the love they have, Jeff and Carmella have more in common.&nbsp;They both have a thing for promoting the well-being of others.&nbsp;That’s why they created the Garcia Pass It On Foundation to support lesser privileges.</span></p><p><span>Also, they both had problems with the law.&nbsp;Wayback in January 2004, Jeff was arrested for impaired driving.&nbsp;That same year, in September, Carmella was taken to court for a bar fight involving Jeff’s ex Kristen Hine.&nbsp;Following the violation of a restraining order, she was fined $150 and given a twenty-four hour community service order.</span></p><ul><li><strong><span>Decesare body measurements</span></strong></li></ul><p><span>Carmella is beautiful, she is not daunting.
