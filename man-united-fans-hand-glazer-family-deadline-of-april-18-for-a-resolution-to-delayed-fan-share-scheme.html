a fan advisory board in December.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The club also confirmed in November last year they were ‘in advanced talks’ with the Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST) about setting up a fans’ share scheme that would give supporters a ‘meaningful ownership stake’ in the club.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But after rejecting an initial proposal from the club despite&nbsp;‘prolonged discussions with the club’, MUST said United had ‘not yet made a proposal to us that is sufficiently acceptable to us to allow it to go to the next stage, which would be a members’ ballot’.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The group then warned it is ‘inconceivable’ there is not definitive action before the anniversary of the bombshell announcement regarding the Super League, especially as Ralf Rangnick’s men ‘continue to decline’ on the field.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Negotiations on these matters can take some time, but we can’t allow them to drag on forever, particularly as in the meantime we continue to see our club decline on the field,’ it added.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async id=i-f9122b69625f6e0b
