including a son with special needs — in the ramshackle Long Island home he grew up in.</p><p>Rex Heuermann’s stunned neighbors in Massapequa Park were nearly united Friday in <a href=#>calling him a quiet businessman </a>and “regular family man.”</p><p>Among them was <a href=#>actor Billy Baldwin</a>, 60, who tweeted his shock at waking to “learn that the Gilgo Beach serial killer suspect was my high school classmate” from Berner High School’s class of 1981.</p><p>“Married, two kids, architect. ‘Average guy… quiet, family man.’ Mind-boggling,” the local-born actor wrote.</p><p>“Massapequa is in shock.”</p><p>The <a href=#>59-year-old architect</a> was raised with his brother, Craig, in the unkempt 1956 home on 1st Avenue that is directly across the bay from where 11 bodies have been found strewn since 2010.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Heuermann, seen here in his company’s bio pic, has always lived in the same house on Long Island. <span class=credit>Rex Heuermann Consultants & Associates</span></figure><p>He bought the house from his mom, Dolores, for $170,000 in 1994, according to property records.</p><p>That was the same year he started his company, RH Architecture Design, based on Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan, where he was arrested late Thursday.</p><p>His daughter was among his staff there — and he also raised a special needs son, according to neighbors.</p><p>Here’s what we know so far about the suspect’s family:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>HIS WIFE</h2><p>Heuermann is married to Asa Ellerup, according to neighbors and reports, which say she is of Icelandic heritage.</p><p>Ellerup, also 59, is listed as living in the same Massapequa Park home — and Heuermann can be seen looking her way in the only photo of herself on her Facebook page.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Heuermann is seen in the background of the only pic his wife, Asa, has of herself on Facebook.</figure><p>However, it gives little other information about her.</p><p>Next-door neighbor Etienne DeVilliers, a retired New York City firefighter, could only describe her as “quiet.”</p><p>Heuermann’s wife was equally mum Friday when she showed up at Suffolk County Court in Riverhead ahead of his expected arraignment later today.</p><p>“Please leave me alone. I will not be saying anything,” she told Newsday, which did not confirm her name but said she told court personnel she was Heuermann’s wife.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>EX-WIFE</h2><p>Heuermann was just 26 when he first married in New Brunswick, New Jersey, according to a 1990 wedding announcement showing him smiling in spectacles in his wedding snap.</p><p>His first wife, Elizabeth Ryan, was described as a “graduate of St. Peter’s High School” also in New Brunswick as well as Montclair State College, where she got a degree in business administration.</p><p>At the time she was a junior planner at a New Jersey office supplies company.</p><p>Heuermann was just an intern at an architecture company at the time, four years before he started his own firm. His brother, Craig, was his best man.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Victoria Heuermann, 26, was seen in this pic on her dad’s company website until Friday, when news broke of his arrest. <span class=credit>rh-architecture.com</span></figure><p>It was not immediately clear when that marriage ended — or why — and attempts to reach Ryan were unsuccessful Friday.</p><p>However, she has lived at her current home for around 15 years, according to neighbors there who told The Post she has been split from Heuermann for at least that long.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>DAUGHTER</h2><p>Heuermann’s 26-year-old daughter Victoria was proudly listed as just four key members of his “team” on his company website Friday — until it got yanked soon after The Post identified him as the suspect.</p><p>The daughter was pictured grinning in sunglasses, without getting a specific title.</p><p>It appears to have been a relatively new gig, however, with her LinkedIn describing her as a “sales associate” at Macy’s until a few years ago.</p><p>She worked at the Manhattan megastore while studying at the New York Institute of Technology, where she recently graduated with a BFA in Fine Arts in 2019, her profile said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Heuermann’s daughter, bottom right, was among just four members of the “team” listed on his company site. <span class=credit>rh-architecture.com</span></figure><p>“I know 3D/2D Animation, Modeling, Sculpting, Autodesk Maya/Mudbox, ZBrush, ToonBoom Harmony, Photoshop, Illustrator, and editing in After Effects and Premier,” she wrote — saying she was “looking for a job in animation,” rather than her dad’s architectural business.</p><p>Attempts to reach her were not immediately successful Friday, and the company she worked at with her dad did not respond to messages seeking comment.</p><p>“She’s very shy,” said DeVilliers, the next-door neighbor.</p><p>“A very nice girl.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>SPECIAL NEEDS SON</h2><p>Neighbors saw less of Heuermann’s son, whom some sources suggested was his stepson.</p><p>“He has a partially disabled kid. A very nice kid,” DeVilliers said of the boy, who does not appear to be listed on the property records.</p><p>“We spoke frequently, every day. And his kid is a nice kid, a special needs kid,” DeVilliers<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> also told CBS News</a>.</p><p>“The guy’s been quiet. Never really bothers anybody. We are kind of shocked.”</p><h2 class=block-info-box__heading>Who is Gilgo Beach serial killer suspect Rex Heuermann?</h2><p>A suspected serial killer <a href=#>has been arrested over the notorious Gilgo Beach murders</a> in Long Island, The Post can confirm.</p><p>Rex Heuermann, 59, a married dad of two and architect at a New York City firm, has a home on 1st Avenue in Massapequa Park, sources told The Post.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Rex Heuermann, a Long Island architect who was charged July 14, 2023, with murder in the deaths of three of the 11 victims in a long-unsolved string of killings known as the Gilgo Beach murders. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>His arrest is tied to the “Gilgo Four,” four women — Melissa Barthelemy, 24, Megan Waterman, 22, Amber Lynn Costello, 27, and Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25 — found wrapped in burlap within days of each other in 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>The body of Barthelemy was first found along Ocean Parkway on Dec. 11, 2010, sparking fears of a serial killer in the area.</p><p>By spring 2011, the number of bodies had climbed to 10, including eight women as well as an unidentified man and toddler.</p><p>Heuermann’s arrest comes after Suffolk County’s new police commissioner created a special Gilgo Beach Homicide Investigation Task Force in February 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>PARENTS</h2><p>Heuermann proudly claimed that his dad, Theo, had been an “aerospace engineer who built satellites” — while also working as a cabinet maker.</p><p>He passed on that skill to the suspect, who said he still makes furniture — and learned to always rely on “a hammer” when he needs to “persuade something.”</p><p>Records show Theo Heuermann died in 1975, when he was 50 and his son would have been just 11.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The suspect bought the house he has always lived in from his mom in 1994, the year he started his own firm. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>His mother, Dolores, appears to still be alive, according to records, which suggest she is 93.</p><p>She sold the 1st Avenue home she raised her family in to Heuermann in 1994, the year the US suffered the so-called Great Bond Massacre financial crisis.</p><p>Heuermann later confirmed that the recession spurred his decision to open his own firm helping companies with NYC’s building department.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3BmamxfrLWiwIywnGajnqTEbq3BqKytZZeeuai7jJucmpuYYsCmvsiao2ajmaG5pr6Mq5yxZZiawqa%2BzJqlp6tdm66utcuyZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./check-out-the-official-posters-for-the-menu-with-stars-anya-taylor-joy-and-ralph-fiennes.html>&#171;&nbsp;Check out the official posters for The Menu, with stars Anya Taylor-Joy and Ralph Fiennes</a>
