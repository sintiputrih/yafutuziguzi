The three new featured players, Sarah Squirm,<a href=#> Aristotle Athari</a>, and James Austin Johnson, were their beacon of hope.</span></p><p><span>So, who is Sarah Squirm? Get to know all about her as this Sarah Squirm Wikipedia proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Sarah Squirm Family</b></h3><p><span>Sarah Squirm, originally known as Sarah Sherman, comes from a Jewish family. She called herself a “f***ing freaky Jewish woman” and claimed her father possed the “Jewish guilt.”</span></p><p><span>“He always says, ‘Just remember, 6 million in the oven, that’s all I’m gonna say.’ That’s Jewish guilt,” Sarah said.</span></p><p><span>Also, Sarah mentioned that her father was working in Manhattan during 9/11 and saw the tragedy happening. He still kept a piece of rubble from the incident kept it in a drawer like a souvenir.</span></p><p><span>Talking more about him, Sarah said that he was a very Howard Ratner kind of guy. He was the most “perverted, vulgar, and a loud-mouthed Jew,” Sarah ever knew. But he is the funniest person to her.</span></p><p><span>Apart from him, Sarah finds her friend Ruby McCollister — who also toured with “Helltrap” — to be the funniest.</span></p><p><span>As for Sarah’s mother. all we know is that her mom could destroy any other’s mom. Or, this was what she said.</span></p><p><span>Fun Fact: After Sarah’s grandmother passed away, she kept her prosthetic glass eyeballs, and made a necklace out of them. Now, it is her good-luck pendant.</span></p><h3><b>Sarah Squirm Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>Sarah Squirm garnered a net worth of under $500 thousand by 2021.</span></p><p><span>A Northwestern grad, Sarah who spent most of her life on Long Island joined the Chicago comedy scene in 2015. But it wasn’t until 2019, she relocated to Los Angeles and entered the big picture.</span></p><p><span>“I’m very gross,” Sarah once described herself. However, her fans love that side of her. From her horror makeup to the disgusting detail orientation she uses in her shows, it was what Sarah was popular for.</span></p><p><span>As of Sept 2021, she was working with </span><i><span>Helltrap Nightmare</span></i><span>, and her next scheduled upcoming event was on October 22 in LA, Regent Theater. Earlier that year, Sarah wrote, directed, and starred in </span><i><span>Sarah Vaccine</span></i><span>, a short film that Paper Mag described as a “maniacal, gross-out and overwhelming response to [our] lockdown hell”.</span></p><p><span>Apart from that, Sarah has also worked as a writer and actress for movies and TV shows like </span><i><span>Holy Trinity</span></i><span> (2019),</span><i><span> Mister America</span></i><span> (2019), </span><i><span>Magical Girl Friendship Squad </span></i><span>(2020),</span><i><span> Magic for Humans</span></i><span> (2020), </span><i><span>Winner Winner Dinner Dinner</span></i><span> (2021), and a few more.</span></p><p><span>In her honor, Sarah was named one of “Vulture’s Comics to Watch” in 2018 and one of </span><i><span>Time Out</span></i><span> magazine’s “Five Comics to Watch” in 2017.</span></p><p><span>If you haven’t been to her shops, Sarah’s act is a combination of one-liners and longer multimedia pieces incorporating PowerPoint slides and video. Her work resembles that of the comedians, Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim. Some of her pieces have even been borrowed from the </span><i><span>Surreal chaos of Pee-wee’s Playhouse</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>The Nanny, </span></i><span>and</span><i><span> The Golden Girls</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Sarah Squirm Partner, Is She A Lesbian?</b></h3><p><span>Sarah Squirm might have termed herself as a “queer” but she had yet to define what her sexual preferences were. So, it’s not completely safe to say that she is a lesbian.</span></p><p><span>However, Sarah once joked about being a lesbian over a tweet, </span><span>“I think something’s wrong with my ballot…it just woke up from a 12-hour nap and started calling me the L-word…”</span></p><p><span>Sarah was also a member of queer alt-comedy, where stars like Stalter, Sarah Squirm, Tien Tran, and ER Fightmaster became her idols.</span></p><p><span>But Sarah never talked about her girlfriends over socials. Instead, we got to hear a million things about her boyfriend over her Tweets. Compiling all the references Sarah made about her “boyfriend”, we’ve concluded that he was a smoker, he had a private Twitter account, and they were together in a live-in relationship during the 2020 lockdown.</span></p><p><span>Also, Sarah joked that she was set on having sex with Noel Fielding and Larry David, whether her boyfriend liked it or not.</span></p><p><span><strong>Trivia:</strong> On Oct 30, 2020, Sarah took it to her Twitter to reveal her first boyfriend. She wrote, “This was my first boyfriend in second life when I was playing as a big titty goth vampire chick in 9th grade.”</span></p><h3>FAQs</h3><ul><li><h4><b>How Old Is Sarah Squirm?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Sarah Squirm was born on May 7, 1992.
