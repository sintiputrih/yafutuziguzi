Shimon, adopting a fake name Simon Leviev, posed to be the son of billionaire Russian-Israeli diamond mogul, Lev Leviev to con women. Anyway, the true-crime documentary, released on 2 February 2022, follows the stories of three of Shimon’s victims: Ayleen Charlotte, <a href=#>Cecile Schrøder </a>Fjellhøy, and <a href=#>Pernilla Sjoholm</a>.</p><p>, who set out to uncover his true identity and fight to bring him to justice. Appearing alongside Fjellhøy and Sjoholm in the Netflix docu is Ayleen Charlotte, who opens up about her experience with Hayut for the very first time. So where is Ayleen Charlotte now and what happened to her?</p><h3><strong>Ayleen Charlotte On Tinder Swindler</strong></h3><p>From the makers of Don’t F*** With Cats, the two-hour-long TheTinder Swindler tells the story of Israeli conman, Shimon Hayut.</p><p>Then, in Ayleen Charlotte’s part of the story, it is disclosed that it was Ayleen who orchestrated the whole arrest of Shimon Hayut, after sharing information with the police.</p><p>Shimon who is now popularly known as “Tinder Swindler” was sentenced to 15 months in prison. However, as the show proceeds, we also learn that he got luckily released after serving just five months behind bars. (It is believed this was due to a program aimed at reducing the prison population amid the coronavirus pandemic.)</p><p>On her first attempt, when the authorities were not able to offer any immediate assistance, Ayleen had decided to seek her revenge. For this, she convinced him that she was still on his side after the revelation that she knows what he has been doing.</p><p>And with her experience of working in the luxury fashion industry, she talked him into handing over his “vast” collection of designer clothes to sell them for a profit. And that is how she managed to get some of it back.</p><h3><strong>Shimon Hayut And Ayleen Charlotte’s Relationship</strong></h3><p>In the documentary, Ayleen Charlotte shared that she had been dating the pretend Simon Leviev for 14 months when an article that included an image of him caught her eye. This article, titled The Tinder Swindler, had been published by the Norwegian publication VG and outlined in great detail the stories of Cecile and Pernilla, where both explained how this man with the real name Shimon Hayut had scammed them out of thousands of dollars.</p><p>So, upon realizing that her relationship with Shimon aligned with these two women’s stories, Ayleen revealed that it left her in shock. Because at that point, she had shared her whole heart with him and thought him to be very thoughtful.</p><p>But Ayleen also soon realized that she too has been a victim of his deception as by then she had already transferred a total of $140,000 to him throughout their relationship. As with her shenanigans, Shimon had tricked her into handing over large sums of money by claiming he was on the run from serious physical threats.</p><h3><strong>Where Is Ayleen Charlotte Today?</strong></h3><p>Today, Ayleen Charlotte prefers to keep details of her life out of the public eye despite signing with Netflix to disclose the great havoc that wrecked on her life.</p><p>As said in the documentary, she is still busy paying off debts that accumulated because of her Israeli ex-boyfriend.</p><p>As for the conman beau, he still lives in Israel as a free man and has never been charged for swindling Charlotte or his other victims.</p><h3><strong>Ayleen Charlotte Age</strong></h3><p>Because Ayleen Charlotte was born in the year 1995, she turned 26 years old in 2021.</p><h3><strong>Ayleen Charlotte Job</strong></h3><p>Ayleen Charlotte professionally belongs to the field of the luxury fashion industry.</p><h3><strong>Is Ayleen Charlotte On IG?</strong></h3><p>Yes. Ayleen Charlotte could be spotted on IG as of 3 February 2022. But, the account @ayleencharlott that included 1 post and 202 followers was set on private mode.</p><p>Also, at this point, Ayleen’s social media activity was not seen on other social media platforms.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Ayleen Charlotte From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Ayleen Charlotte hails from Amsterdam, in the Netherlands.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Ayleen Charlotte Dating Anyone New?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Ayleen Charlotte chose not to disclose her current relationship status and other personal aspects of her life on the Netflix program.</p><p>But then dating again and the idea of trusting a man again must have terrified her. Because, as Ayleen says, she loved Shimon. All those times they were together, this man used to be so thoughtful and would remember every little thing about her. In Ayleen’s words, they even started to talk about settling down together. She felt like he was the one and that they were meant to be together.</p><p>So, it was devastating when Ayleen learned that she was not the only one. This man not only had other partners, but the way and the time he spoke to them was the same as well, whether it be in texts, videos, or pictures.</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmmrGcmrKvecKhmKukn6nBpnnBoqZmmZeaerW7w5qwZqKfl3qqs4ytoKeclad6tMPIp5ulnaJk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-bryan-barberena-wife-diana-barberena-meet-the-ufc-fighter-on-instagram.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Is Bryan Barberena Wife Diana Barberena?
