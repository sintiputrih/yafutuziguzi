He said it was Silverman's Emmy-winning "I'm f--ing Matt Damon" video that helped him get there.</p><p>"That's when people really woke up to the show and noticed what we're doing," Kimmel said of Silverman's hit appearance on his show. "There were occasional moments along the way before that, but that's where it really kicked in."</p><p>He went on to share that the viral video was made for him on his 40th birthday. "We happened to be on writer's strike at that time," Kimmel recalled. "So it was a good five years in before [that breakout moment]." However, ABC's former CEO and current Disney boss, Bob Iger said it took Kimmel "10 years to get good at it." The host thought Iger was "right" about it, though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In January 2023, on Jimmy Kimmel Live!'s 20th anniversary, the funnyman thanked the "many great people" behind the show, saying "very few people expected us to make it this far." After a few jokes like selling his soul to the devil for fame, he got emotional, saying: "It takes a lot of people to make something this dumb, and we've covered a lot of dumb stuff over the past 20 years."</p><p>Jimmy Kimmel "was very intent on retiring" during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike but changed his mind because it's "nice to work."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/your-paragraph-text-2024-01-04t130448-694.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Fans Think Jimmy Kimmel's Worst Interview Ever Went "Downhill" After He Embarrassed His Guest With "Unseen Footage"</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Fans felt as though Jimmy Kimmel didn't take a certain interview serious enough given the actor's exceptional performance in the film he promoted.</span><h2 id=sarah-silverman-said-quot-fat-quot-jimmy-kimmel-had-quot-no-charisma-quot-when-they-first-met>Sarah Silverman Said "Fat" Jimmy Kimmel Had "No Charisma" When They First Met</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar48697388.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2001, amid Kimmel's divorce from Gina Maddy, he met Silverman for the first time at the New York Friars Club Roast of Hugh Hefner. There, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the latter roasted her future beau</a>, saying he was "fat" with "no charisma." Soon, they "started hanging out and watching movies together" until "one night we were watching Broadway Danny Rose. Jimmy went in for the first kiss," Silverman recounted.</p><p>"Both of us — we were probably nose to nose for what seemed like forty minutes before either of us had the guts to just go ahead and kiss," she said of their first kiss. "But once we did, we started making out like crazy. It had been festering for a very long time."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They started dating in 2002 when Kimmel's divorce was finalized. A year into the relationship, Silverman said she couldn't believe he called her boyfriend "fat" on their first meeting. "It's weird looking back at that. I didn't know him at all back then," the actress told Entertainment Weekly in 2003. "I can't believe I called him fat. Knowing him now, it's funny because he has such a thin personality."</p><p>Here's a brief timeline of their seven-year relationship:</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>2001</p></td><td><p>Kimmel and Silverman met for the first time</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2002</p></td><td><p>The two started dating</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2008</p></td><td><p>They split for the first time but soon reconciled</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2009</p></td><td><p>They break up again, for good</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2017</p></td><td><p>Kimmel said he and Silverman were friends again (which took them a while to do)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/jimmy-kimmel-criticized-craig-ferguson-for-quitting-the-late-late-show-too-early-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel Criticized Craig Ferguson For Quitting The Late Late Show Too Early</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Craig Ferguson was surprised when Jimmy Kimmel brought up the former's abrupt departure from The Late-Late Show.</span><h2 id=how-jimmy-kimmel-and-sarah-silverman-became-quot-like-brothers-quot-after-their-split>How Jimmy Kimmel And Sarah Silverman Became "Like Brothers" After Their Split</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/untitled-6.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2017, Kimmel told GQ that he and Silverman were "like brothers." He said "it doesn't make sense to me that people would erase a big part of their lives. It's not like we didn't spend every day together for many years. We did, and we have a lot of things in common and mutual friends. I'll see something in the news and think, Oh, my God. I have to tell Sarah about this."</p><p>But speaking to Cohen in 2019, Kimmel admitted that "it definitely took some time to be comfortable enough to be friends again," In 2010, Silverman told Playboy that they "had every intention of spending the rest of our lives with each other." The late-night host eventually married screenwriter, Molly McNearney in 2013. A year later, Silverman tweeted that she'd never get married.</p><p>"I just don't understand the instinct to want to join a club that is elitist," Silverman said of marriages. "I mean it's like joining a country club that doesn't allow Jews or black people. What's the difference?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2020, the Maestro star started dating The Daily Show's former showrunner, Rory Albanese. When <strong><a href=#>Howard Stern</a></strong> asked if Silverman could see herself marrying Albanese, she said: "We'd like to just be together all the time forever. If Rory was someone who was like, 'I need to be married,' then yeah, I'd think about it, I guess." The two are still happily dating. In 2022, Silverman said she "[shares] a toothbrush with [her] boyfriend."</p><p>Sarah Silverman started dating her boyfriend Rory Albanese in late 2020 after remotely playing video games together during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihoqWdrnqstcymnKVlp5a2tbHDZp2irpVixqat0axkn6eiYrWqv4ysn6ivXam8br%2FUnJqenZRiwamtzaSqZqyfYrK5ecafZLCgn2LAorXDZp%2BeZZiWsW66zmaaoZminsCurY4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./michael-blackson.html>&#171;&nbsp;Michael Blackson - Bio, Career, Age, Net Worth, Height, Facts</a>
