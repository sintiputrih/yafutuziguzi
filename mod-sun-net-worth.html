So far, he has released three studio albums and has come to prominence through his songs “Shoot ‘Em Down”, with Machine Gun Kelly & Blackbear, and “My Hippy”, among other creations.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Mod Sun is, as of late 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Sun’s net worth is as high as $200,000, an amount earned through his successful career in the music world, active since the mid- 2000s.</p><h3>Mod Sun Net Worth $200,000</h3><p>Before becoming Mod Sun, Derek had to live through a troubled childhood; his parents divorced, and he first lived with his father in Long Beach, California, but then started living with his mother, who often changed jobs and moved across the USA. As a response to all these troubles, Derek developed a bipolar disorder, but decided not to take medications for it. When was 18 years old, he changed his name from Derek to Dylan.</p><p>His musical beginnings trace back to 2004 when he became a drummer in the post-hardcore band Four Letter Lie. He worked on two albums of the band, their debut release “Let Your Body Take Over” (2006), and “What a Terrible Thing to Say” in 2008 before departing from the band in 2009. The sales of the albums only increased his net worth, but that wasn’t enough for him to support his life. He gave in to drugs, not only using but also selling the illegal substance. He wanted to get away from selling and sought another musical engagement, and he would join the post-hardcore band Scary Kids Scaring Kids in 2009, but his stint was short since the group ceased to exist in 2010.</p><p>While a part of the Scary Kids Scaring Kids, he started using name Mod Sun for the first time, and even before the disbandment, he ventured on a solo career, releasing mixtapes “I’ll Buy Myself”, “Let Ya Teeth Show” and “How to Make a MOD SUN”, all in 2009. The following year, he released his first EP – “The Hippy Hop EP” – and then worked on several other releases, including the EPs “In MOD We Trust”, “Happy as Fuck”, and mixtapes “Blazed by the Bell” and “First Take”, before he began working on his first full-length album, “Look Up”, released in 2015, through Rostrum Records, the sales of which increased his net worth by a large degree. Most recently, Mod Sun has released his second and third albums, “Movie” and “BB”, in early 2017, the sales of which added a substantial amount to his net worth.</p><p>Aside from his musical career, Mod Sun has also been recognized as an author, and so far has released the non-fiction book “Did I Ever Wake Up”, which was created after he took LSD. He also stated that LSD changed his way of life, and has proclaimed that he will pass on his happiness to everyone he knows.</p><p>Furthermore, he has published a book of poetry, “My Dear Pink” in 2015, and a couple of journals “Happy to be Here” (2015), and “Happy to be Here pt. 2” in 2016, further increasing his net worth.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Mod Sun is married, but there are no further details about his marriage, including his wife’s identity and date of their wedding.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjsLC5jqamnWWjqrtuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-happened-to-jake-fromm.html>&#171;&nbsp;What happened to Jake Fromm?</a>
