flood.

Walsh worked full-time for nine months creating over 100 pieces for the show.<i><br></i></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ebe/494/24f2fdc5b4bb20c5176592582138698cd1-9-devils-nests.h473.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-6-0-0@published data-word-count=183>According to DiGerlando, there was very little detail about what a “devil’s nest” should look like in the script. Pizzolatto’s rough guidelines specified that they should have a spiral motif and be able to stand on their own. “They were described as sort of watching over that first crime scene,” DiGerlando said. They decided on a tripod structure, which, if laid on its side, would have a spiral naturally build in from the bottom. “We were also told all of this artwork is the killer’s way of ascension to reach this spiritual plain that he has in his mind,” DiGerlando said. “Thus, the ladder aspect. You’ll notice a lot of the tripods have cross-members going up the sides.” Not all of them, though. No two look the same. They show up throughout the series at the girl’s playhouse, the abandoned school, the Ledoux meth compound, “and for reasons best not to get into, we wanted subtly different looks for each of those settings. It wasn’t as simple as making an assembly line for them. Josh Walsh designed each one for each specific set.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/4f2/ac2/9cc8dfae329eaa8e06ab817b16f711e093-2-church.rsquare.w400.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-8-0-0@published data-word-count=149>DiGerlando found Walsh by chance. For inspiration, DiGerlando had already pulled the art of primitive and voodoo cultures, and of outsider artists Henry Darger and James Castle, when he spotted a small hummingbird sculpture made by Walsh on the desk of set decorator Cynthia Slagter. It was made of twine and sinew and reeds and little sticks, which matched up with DiGerlando’s vision for the killer’s art. “We wanted it to have a primitive, primal feeling,” he said. “He isn’t a person who went to art school. He’s a person who has some deep inner urge to express himself, and he does it through these murders and these constructions. Josh went very Method and made most of the pieces using the materials he thought this guy would use: mud, ripped-up pieces of children’s clothes that he bought at thrift stores, roots. He’d wander through the marsh on shopping expeditions.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-9-0-0@published data-word-count=3><b>The Crime Scene</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-10-0-0@published data-word-count=35>In the series premiere, Hart and Cohle find the slain body of a prostitute, who had been tied up, raped, mutilated, and crowned with deer antlers, in a scorched sugar field outside of Erath, Louisiana.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c38/542/24d172f1d1d6049c3d212802387b5886d4-1-crime-scene.h473.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-12-0-0@published data-word-count=147>In the original script, the detectives find Dora Lange’s corpse bent over in prayer in the woods with wings attached to her back. The first thing to go were the woods. “There aren’t great woods in Louisiana. It’s more of a swamp,” DiGerlando said. Production swapped in a particularly striking sugar cane field that he had scouted for the finale (which no longer takes place there). “They were burning the fields to clear them at the time, and it was so moody and atmospheric setting for this bizarre altar.” Pizzolatto replaced the wings with antlers for an equally pragmatic reason. “There was something else he remembered that used wings. I think it was <a href=#><i>Red Riding</i></a>,” DiGerlando said. “It was always written that she was in a kneeling position, though, praying toward the tree, and there were always three of the twig sculptures standing by looking over her.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-13-0-0@published data-word-count=2><b>The Spirals</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-14-0-0@published data-word-count=30>You see them everywhere. <a href=#>The bird formation</a>.

(“This is a world where nothing is solved,” Cohle says in the 2012 timeline. “Someone once told me time is a flat circle. Everything we’ve ever done or will do, we’re gonna do over and over and over again.”) They’re all associated with the killer. Pizzolatto drew a spiral image himself, and Walsh refined the final irregular shape by taking a wire clothing hanger and twisting it into a spiral. “The idea being these guys — the killer and the LeDoux brothers — would use it as a branding tool,” DiGerlando said.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-17-0-0@published data-word-count=69>For those tracking the appearances of the spirals, you can cross off the one you found in Hart’s house. That was a mistake. “I didn’t even notice that one,” DiGerlando said. “We got a whole bunch of artwork from the daughter of a friend of mine down the street and used it to decorate Marty’s house. None of us put it together that there was a spiral in there.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-18-0-0@published data-word-count=3><b>Cohle’s Empty Apartment</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-19-0-0@published data-word-count=30>White walls, a mattress, a cross.

One, we have a lot of that kind of stuff in the show anyway, and two, it didn’t seem to make sense that a detective, as crazy or as self-destructive as Rust may seem, would live in such a disgusting place.” They went in the opposite direction: spartan style. “It’s no more and no less than what he needs to survive, and that tells you everything you need to know about him. He doesn’t need anything extraneous.” They wound up jettisoning nearly everything from the room, including a sofa bed, a box spring, a nightstand. “It pays off later on when Maggie shows up and you see him by himself flashing his flashlight at the antlers, trying to figure it out,” DiGerlando said. “He doesn’t want the distraction of anything else. The case is where he lives. That is, he lives in his own mind and there’s nothing extraneous in there.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-22-0-0@published data-word-count=3><b>The Beer-Can Men<br></b><i></i></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-23-0-0@published data-word-count=116>They’re a motif that runs throughout Pizzolatto’s work. “I think they show up in his novel, too,” DiGerlando said. “You’d have to ask him where it comes from.” Getting the look just right took some experimenting. It had to be someone McConaughey could do with ease while spouting Cohle’s bleak worldviews. Pizzolatto had described the men as having lids for heads, but that didn’t work. “We found that it looked a little goofy, almost too comical, DiGerlando said. “We had cut the rim off the top of the can and folded it up so the hole where you’d drink from became the mouth. It looked like Edvard Munch’s The Scream, with this big head bobbing around.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ebe/494/24f2fdc5b4bb20c5176592582138698cd1-9-devils-nests.h473.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-25-0-0@published data-word-count=70>Another version used two cans for every one man. Like Cohle’s apartment, they wound up stripping it down to the most minimal figure. As for using <i>Lone Star</i>, DiGerlando said they were the brand game to let their beer cans be used for purposes other than drinking. “It was just serendipitous that it happened to lend itself to the way the star lays out on the beer-can men,” he said.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-26-0-0@published data-word-count=3><b>The Burned-Down Church</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-27-0-0@published data-word-count=40>At the end of episode two, Hart and Cohle arrive at the torched remains of Pastor Theriot’s (Shea Whigham) old church.

The challenge was in finding the right piece of land, which needed to be off the beaten track — so that Hart and Cohle would have to follow their leads to it — but near a road. They settled on the not-so-accommodating patch behind the spillway. “You had to get to it by driving down a service road over a levee, down a mud road, and then we even had to drop down gravel to make it reachable. There was a lot of, <i>Is this worth it?</i>” DiGerlando laughed. “But we all loved the location, having the water and all those refineries in the distance, and the train tracks. What luck to be able to get that shot with the train going by as they pull up. And having that natural brush hitting the church? The approach to the church looked excellent.” The church itself took a month to build. They kept a fire going throughout to char the wood they used to built the skeletal back of the building.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-30-0-0@published data-word-count=124>Inside the church, they brought back Ella Densen — the same 7-year-old who produced the artwork of Marty’s daughters — to do the Biblical scenes found on the walls. The script specified David and Goliath and Jesus and the leper, among others. Later, Walsh came in to paint the girl with antlers on top of Ella’s work, which he produced using the leftover charred wood as smudge sticks. “There’s a lot going on,” DiGerlando said. “If you stopped and looked, you’d see his artwork on top of hers and then the greens and vines over that, and the idea being a couple months prior to the detectives’ arrival, the church burned down and the killer at some point showed up and left his mark.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-31-0-0@published data-word-count=9><b>The Offices of the Louisiana State Criminal Investigations Division<br></b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-32-0-0@published data-word-count=27>It’s the only set seen in every episode.

It’s a conference room in 1995 that gradually becomes more of a storage area, which is why boxes and typewriters hang out in the background when Hart and Cohle are being interrogated later on. “It was a lot of moving old computers out and new computers in, hiding and displaying wires for IT,” he said. “We built all of it: the evidence room Marty breaks into, the turquoise checkered flooring, all of it.” The offices are set inside an old lightbulb warehouse in Elmwood, Louisiana. “It had a dated architectural look, dated for even 1995, with this pebbled texture, these interesting skinny windows with arched tops, and this fantastic lobby with the free-floating staircase,” DiGerlando said. “We wanted it to not look like it was new in 1995.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c38/542/24d172f1d1d6049c3d212802387b5886d4-1-crime-scene.h473.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-36-0-0@published data-word-count=4><b>Cohle’s Big Hug Mug</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-37-0-0@published data-word-count=90>“I had nothing to do with it,” DiGerlando laughed.

They’re worth a small fortune now.” There’s no secret message hidden there, either, though DiGerlando said they did look for any opportunity to insert some levity into the show, “because it is relentlessly dark.”</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e78/3eb/b8cd711ee7917159f4bdc9637ac98f7e84-06-big-hug-mug.h473.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-39-0-0@published data-word-count=5><b>Pastor Theriot’s Tent Revival Church</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-40-0-0@published data-word-count=56>In the beginning of episode three, “The Locked Room,” Hart and Cohle find the pastor preaching in his new church (“This world is a veil, and the face you wear is not your own,” Theriot says) made out of a tent top and decorated with painted-on scripture verses. “This was one of my favorites,” DiGerlando said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ce5/9ab/fc286aebb5b8180e275a46aba37fddef50-4-rusts-apartment.h473.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-42-0-0@published data-word-count=119>Many of the revival tents DiGerlando found in his research were striped, which felt too much like a circus, so he opted for a plain one with a big ol’ cross on top. He found a company that made them, but had to create a 3-D model of the tent to figure out how big they could make the cross and have it fit in the frame with Pastor Theriot mid-sermon. Scenic artists came to “dirty up” the fabric and draw in the words as though they were hand-done by the congregation. “The tent revival feels a bit lost in time,” DiGerlando said. “You don’t see them as often, and there’s a sadness to it which I really liked.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5cb/02a/e2df7410027c059e7c8718375152eec02d-12-beer-can-men.h473.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-44-0-0@published data-word-count=3><b>The A</b><b>b</b><b>andoned School</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-45-0-0@published data-word-count=52>At the end of episode five, Cohle revisits the devastated school once attended by Rianne Olivier.

We wanted them to feel like they were sitting there, as if they were students in the classroom,” he said. “They kind of reminded us of these photographs Robert Polidari took of <a href=#>Chernobyl</a>.” Walsh came back to paint the scary “see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil” cherubs on the wall. “You can really see when he picks up that devil’s nest and looks from the bottom how it has that spiral effect.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-48-0-0@published data-word-count=2><b>Beth’s Apartment<br></b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-49-0-0@published data-word-count=32>The young prostitute Hart encouraged to leave the bunny ranch in 1995 resurfaces in 2002 (episode six, “Haunted Houses”) with a new job, her own place, and her sights set on Hart. <b><br></b></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/4df/166/72f36801f0b3a4999d4ccb10e49cf4ca0a-8-beths-apartment-2.h473.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-51-0-0@published data-word-count=200>“A lot of these characters are so damaged and living in very desolate living situations, and Beth (Lili Simmons) is a character who actually pulled herself out of a not so great situation,” DiGerlando said. To that end, he made her apartment in 2002 a kind of extension of Jan’s trailer at the bunny ranch where Beth worked. “We tried to make that trailer a little homey, add some feminine qualities to make it … more a shade of gray than just the place where this horrible madame exploits these girls. There’s dialogue in the scene to that effect, that there’s more to it than Marty would think,” DiGerlando said. “We wanted to make sure Beth had some dimension and a real interior life. Her apartment had to be a place she’d walk in and say, ‘This is my home.’ She’s got a straight job, she’s going to want something nice, and we interpreted that to mean not a cookie-cutter apartment.” To give it some character, he added an arch, put up floral wallpaper, gave it an odd stucco texture, and created a DIY canopy bed that DiGerlando had spotted on a scouting trip made of blankets and old dresses.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b82/d04/c2b34b5fc4428efbcacd5573fc9cb5a31f-8-beths-apartment-3.h473.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-53-0-0@published data-word-count=5><b>The Ledoux Cousins’ Meth Compound</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-54-0-0@published data-word-count=53>We first see Reggie Ledoux briefly at the end of episode three on his meth compound wearing a jockstrap and gas mask.

But the most important detail for DiGerlando was the locked room in which the children were being hidden. “I knew early on I wanted to use the cube from a cube truck for that,” he said. “The way it unlocks, I knew there’d be drama in that.”</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5ac/2b0/b074b79eb48585427b7a02116e0ff071bc-11-ledoux-tattoos.h473.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-58-0-0@published data-word-count=3><b>Cohle’s Storage Unit</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-d742713075670b519ab9be71733bdea8-59-0-0@published data-word-count=39>Turns out Rust’s even more obsessed with the case than we thought!

He had himself a vision quest,” DiGerlando said. That’s because the storage unit was the culmination of everything Cohle had drudged up between 1995 and 2012. To make sure the space was bursting with stuff, Reiss held photo shoots, hired artists, created books (like the one on how to build devil’s nests), worked up detailed documents and newspaper clippings — all to demonstrate years of obsession. “It’s not like you can call up an image library and say, ‘Give me all your pictures of dead bodies.’ We had to generate all that,” DiGerlando said, pointing to the weird occult paraphernalia, the photo of the girl with the horses, microfiche, photo copies, the yearbook, and all the stuff that had previously been in Rust’s apartment. “It should look like maybe Rust was around more than we thought he was, like he had in fact been working on this case for years.” And there’s an order to all of it. “He’s meticulous, so while it may look messy, everything is in place. There’s an area for the maps, an area for his photographs, things that inspire him. There’s even an area where he experiments with the construction of how he might make a devil’s nest.<b>”</b></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/746/aff/8644ce5809c2bb837cdad402208139961e-3-storage-unit-2.h473.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=ambrose-short-hed>Origin Stories of <i>True Detective</i>’s Set Pieces</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobWdgaHy1vtSeZJ2dpJqwtbXVnmSapJWteqW1xp6ppZmembxuv8StZJ2do560r3nPq6apq12eu7Wx0a%2Bgnq9encGuuA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./miranda-scarlett-schneider-biography.html>&#171;&nbsp;Miranda Scarlett Schneider Bio (Wiki)</a>
