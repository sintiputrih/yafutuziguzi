Anthony Anderson, her 18-year-old son, was already a father figure to her. She had no husband and no job when she gave birth for the first time. Despite this, she raised Anthony as a single mother.</p><p>Doris later married Sterling Bowman. Anthony’s stepfather’s name was Sterling. However, Anthony regarded him as a true father. Sterling and Doris had only one child, Derrick Bowman. Derrick works as an ER Technician at Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital. Joy Stevenson is his wife.</p><p>Doris appeared to be <strong>divorced</strong> from her husband Sterling as of 2021. Doris had stated that she was currently “single and looking.” “He has to be tall… and not a couch potato,” she said of her ideal man. And he has to work and put gas in my car!”</p><p>Doris was an oddball, as you might have guessed from the Celebrity Family Feud episode. She used to give her kids Vagisil, a cream used to treat vaginal itching and to treat cuts and bruises. Another strange fact: Doris taught her son, Anthony, how to have oral sex. She stated that her husband, Anthony’s father, was a jerk when it came to oral sex and that she did not want her son to be the same.</p><h2><span id=Doris_Hancox-_Professional_Career>Doris Hancox- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Doris’s Facebook page indicates that she works for Los Angeles County in California. Doris, on the other hand, had other plans for her life.</p><p>Doris wanted to be an actress when she was younger. However, as a young single mother (as described in the following section), she had to put her ambition on hold.</p><p>Doris did get her chance to act, albeit a little late. In 2008, she appeared in the short film, Common Bond. She also appeared in the film The Truth in 2010. She made an appearance on an episode of the <strong>TV show Black-ish in 2017</strong>.</p><p>Aside from her acting roles, she had appeared as herself in several reality shows. In fact, she had an intriguing story about her first game show. In 2015, she appeared on Celebrity Family Feud with her son, Anthony Anderson.</p><p>When asked on the show, “Name something a new magician might pull a rabbit out of,” she replied, “his nuts.” Doris apparently misheard “new” as “nude.” The host, Steve Harvey, was taken aback by her response, which embarrassed her son.</p><p>Later, the show’s producers approached Anderson to discuss his mother. Anderson quickly apologized. However, they intended to bring her to To Tell You the Truth. They were blown away by her personality.</p><p>Doris did appear on To Tell You the Truth, and she is still on the show after five years and 61 episodes. Fans of the show referred to her as Mama Doris. She was a fan favorite on the show. She was absent for a few episodes in 2021. People were concerned that she had left the show. She did make a quick return to the show. She did not, however, explain why she was absent from the show.</p><p>Access Hollywood, Good Morning America, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, The Talk, Access Daily, Animal Nation with Anthony Anderson, Extra with Billy Bush, Entertainment Tonight, and others are among her other reality TV credits.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_Color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair Color</span></h2><p>Doris Hancox is a<strong> 5 ft 9-inch tall </strong>woman who weighed<strong> 64 kgs.</strong> Her distinguishing features include dark black hair, brown eyes, and large loopy earrings, which she wore on the majority of occasions.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Details>Social Media Details</span></h2><p>Doris Hancox was not well-known on social media.
