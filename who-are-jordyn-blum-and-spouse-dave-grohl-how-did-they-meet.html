As a producer and film director, Jordyn Blum isn’t doing badly, she has worked over the years and amassed a reasonable amount of fortune.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-spouse-dave-grohl></span><strong>Her Spouse Dave Grohl</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dave Grohl is notable for his works as an American singer, songwriter, musician, and director.

David once said that they never met at the right place or in a good position. He was trying to drown his fears and in the process met a woman who he finally fell in love with. That settles the saying, life is what happens when you are busy making other plans.</p><p>Well, while being drunk, he scribbled&nbsp;the words ‘You’re my future ex-wife’ with his number on a sheet of paper and passed it on to the actress. Every woman at that position would imagine how hilarious that was. Never did Jordy know that she would one day walk down the aisle with the musician.</p><p>Jordyn Blum and Dave Grohl finally started dating and guess what, it wasn’t as beautiful as they thought it would have been. Dave Grohl’s temptation that period worsened as he passed through the shitty phase of life and couldn’t manage under the pressures of life.</p><p>Eventually, his love life began to suffer and every form of communication with Jordyn became history. While in his mess, his bandmate Taylor Hawkins suffered a drug overdose and it was then that Dave Grohl drew his life lessons and decided that he wanted better for his life. That singular decision pushed him back to his senses leading to the Jordyn Blum and Dave Grohl happy ending love tale.</p><p>For the records, Dave Grohl was once married to Jenif<span style=color:#222;font-size:14px>fer Youngblood.
