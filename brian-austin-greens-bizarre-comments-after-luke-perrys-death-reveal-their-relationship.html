Of course, everyone, including <a href=#>Luke Perry's two kids</a> and fiance Wendy Madison Bauer, is still processing their grief. While the entire 90210 cast still misses the actor who <strong>played</strong><strong>Dylan McKay</strong>, Brian Austin Green's comments about Luke Perry stand out the most.</p><p>Since <a href=#>Green has had health issues</a> himself, it makes sense that he would talk about the end of his co-star's life. However, some of the things that Green has said about Perry's death are more than a little bit perplexing...</p><h2 id=what-did-brian-austin-green-say-about-beverly-hills-90210-co-star-luke-perry-39-s-death>What Did Brian Austin Green Say About Beverly Hills 90210 Co-Star Luke Perry's Death?</h2><p>While the <a href=#>Beverly Hills, 90210 cast members still have acting careers</a>, they will always be remembered because of their famous characters. When Brian Austin Green <strong>played David Silver on 90210</strong>, he and Luke Perry must have bonded because they stayed close after that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In January 2024, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian Austin Green talked about Luke Perry</a> on the podcast Getting Grilled with Curtis Stone. Green said that he texted Perry when he had been gone for a day, which is surprising and strange to hear about. He must have been going through the stages of grief. It's common for people to be in denial about their loved one passing away. Not everyone will admit that they have actually texted or phoned their late loved one, though.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/beverly-hills-90210-brian-austin-green.jpg><p>Green explained:</p><p>“There was a part of me that couldn’t really process that that was real. I texted him the day after he passed. Just because there was a part of me that was like, ‘No, he’s gonna answer back. He’s hiding somewhere. Or something’s happened.’"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Green continued, " I didn’t completely believe that, but there was a big part of me that was hoping that that was the case.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/luke-perry-before-his-passing.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Is Brian Austin Green’s Scandalous Personal Life The Reason His Career Stalled After Beverly Hills 90210?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Brian Austin Green made a name for himself as David Silver and his relationship problems could explain his lackluster post-Beverly Hills 90210 career.</span><p>This is something that Green talked about back in 2019. According to Page Six, he said on his podcast ...with Brian Austin Green and said, “I texted him after he passed, knowing obviously that he can’t text me back but on some level, hoping that he would text me back, or that he was out there somewhere. And I know he is. I know he’s looking down and I know he’s smiling.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/brian-austin-green-dated-more-beverly-hills-90210-co-stars-than-just-tiffani-thiessen-here-s-the-truth-about-these-lesser-known-relationships.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Green's comments prove that <strong>he and Perry were extremely close</strong>, which might not be something that Beverly Hills, 90210 fans would assume. After all, fans have been reading about the countless fights on set for years. But it doesn't sound like Perry and Green ever had any drama. Instead, they must have connected easily and stayed in touch ever since the show went off the air. Green only ever praises his former co-star.</p><p>Brian Austin Green made a second strange <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">comment about Luke Perry's death</a>: if the late actor had survived, Perry would have found it challenging.</p><p>Luke Perry's Memorable Movie And TV Roles</p><ul><li>Dylan McKay in Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990-1995, 1998-2000)</li><li>Wayne Maunder in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019)</li><li>Fred Andrews in Riverdale (2017-2019, 2021)</li><li>Linc Stark in John From Cincinnati (2007)</li><li>Oliver Pike in Buffy The Vampire Slayer (1992)</li><li>Boyd in Redemption Road (2010)</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to People, Green appeared on the podcast Comfort Food with Kelly Rizzo and explained that <strong>healing from a stroke could be a years-long process</strong>. He doesn't think that Perry would have wanted that. He said, "And I knew there was a part of me with him, with the loss of him, where I felt like maybe that was the best thing to happen for him because ... Luke took pride in who he was. He was very quick-witted. He was very kind. He was very generous. And to have to not have any of those, any of those things missing at all would have so severely affected him."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/brian-austin-green.jpg><p>Green continued:</p><p>"I think for recovery, possibly taking for years anywhere near there, it would have been really, really difficult for him, And Luke honestly, was either to me...

There was no middle ground."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the one hand, what Green said makes sense because people never want their loved ones to suffer or lose themselves in the wake of an illness. On the other hand, Luke Perry's two kids have grieved this loss, and he was also <strong>engaged to Wendy Madison Bauer</strong>. It's easy to imagine that Perry would have wanted to continue living so he could be with his family.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/brian-austin-green-may-have-refused-to-see-his-son-kassius-lijah-for-five-years-here-s-the-truth-about-their-relationship-today.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Brian Austin Green's Secret History Of Legal Drama Cast The Former Beverly Hills 90210 Star In A Complicated Light</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Brian Austin Green was beloved for his role on Beverly Hills 90210, but he has been part of a number of lawsuits that fans will want to hear about...</span><p>According to Cafe Mom, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke Perry had a few health conditions</a> before the stroke that ended his life. In 2015, he had precancerous growth in his body that was then taken out. He also had surgery for back issues.
