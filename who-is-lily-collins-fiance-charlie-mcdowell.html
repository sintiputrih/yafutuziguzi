Who is this man who's inspired all the glowing Instagram posts and declarations of love from the Emily in Paris and Mank (2020) star? Here's what we know about Charlie McDowell.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">McDowell and Collins got married in September 2021.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">A year after getting engaged, McDowell and Collins had their wedding secretly. Collins wore a Ralph Lauren column gown and got married to McDowell in Colorado's Dunton Hot Springs. “I’ve never wanted to be someone’s someone more than I do yours, and now I get to be your wife,” Collins wrote alongside <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/CTiCdtSplUi/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="their wedding photo" class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">their wedding photo</a>, posted on September 7. “On September 4th, 2021 we officially became each other’s forever. I love you beyond.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">Of the event, Collins said she was on set for Emily In Paris during the planning so McDoweel handled a lot.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">“I was in the midst of planning it while shooting the show, nine hours ahead. Finishing filming and then Zooming with people and answering emails,” she said. “[It] was very exciting and great; it was just all happening at once.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">They celebrated their one-year anniversary in September 2022.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">As of summer 2023, Collins is regularly sharing photos with McDowell on her Instagram.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">Collins has been very open about her relationship for a Hollywood starlet. She often posts photos from her life and travels with McDowell. The couple <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://cphpost.dk/2023-03-08/news/emily-in-paris-becomes-collins-in-copenhagen/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="bought property" class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">bought property</a> in Copenhagen and recently described their home team as being the city's football club.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">In July 2023, she posted a gushing tribute to McDowell for his 40th birthday.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">Collins fêted her husband's milestone 40th birthday with a heartfelt Instagram tribute. “Happy HUGE birthday to my one!” she started. “You may now be 40 but let’s be honest, you’ll actually, truly, always be forever young. Here’s to the last 4 decades of light you’ve cast into this world, laughs you’ve brought to everyone around you, passion you’ve shared with audiences everywhere, love you’ve given those closest to you, beauty and art you’ve created, and memories you’ve cherished alongside the ones you’ve built your life with. I’m the luckiest lady there is to journey beside you in our next decades to come. I couldn’t love you more or be more in awe of your heart, talent, and infinite sense of humor. Thank you for being the man you are and inspiring me to be the woman I am. You’re my partner in crime, my best friend, and my constant adventure. Happy 40th my love. I can’t wait to grow even older with you and keep frolicking into the future together. Wherever that may lead us…”</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">McDowell is a child of Hollywood legends.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">Like Collins, whose father is British musician Phil Collins, McDowell comes from an entertainment family. Upon first guess, you might think he's related to actress Andie MacDowell (it's a different spelling, but they do have a pretty funny connection. More on that later). His mom is actually a different legendary actress, Mary Steenburgen (aka the iconic mom in basically every rom-com).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">His dad is British actor Malcolm McDowell, with whom Steenburgen shares McDowell (37) and his sister Lilly McDowell Walton (40).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">Steenburgen divorced Malcolm in 1991 and married The Good Place and Cheers actor Ted Danson in 1995. Danson has two daughters, Kate and Alexis Danson, from his marriage to his first wife, Cassandra "Casey" Coates.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">"When I was a teenager I didn't understand why <a href=# tabindex=0 data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/msteenburgen/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@msteenburgen class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">@msteenburgen</a> made us do this," Collins' fiancé wrote alongside a photo of his blended family in 2017. "But I get it now. You wanted us to be able to pose harder than any other bitch ass in the room. Thank you. And happy Mother's Day."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">Malcolm McDowell has three sons with his wife, Kelley Kuhr: Beckett, Finnias, and Seamus.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">He's a filmmaker.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">McDowell is a writer/director. His major directing projects have been The One I Love (2014) starring Elisabeth Moss, Mark Duplass, and Ted Danson; Silicon Valley (2016); and The Discovery (2017). He has also directed two episodes of On Becoming a God in Central Florida (2019), Dear White People (2017-2018), and is <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1660595/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="behind several more projects" class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">behind several more projects</a>. He made a comedy short, Bye Bye Benjamin, in 2006, when he was 22 years old.

"Two annoying girls moved into the apartment above me, he writes on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.deargirlsaboveme.com/post/date/2012/10 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the site where the open letters are archived" class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">the site where the open letters are archived</a>. "I'm forced to hear every dumb thing they say.

In December 2019, Collins responded to social media comments:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">"This week I saw some messages and comments that were really hurtful to me and someone I love," she wrote, in part. "It's never okay to verbally abuse, bully, or threaten people even if you don't agree with their opinion or sense of humor."</p><h2 data-node-id=40 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">He has one long-running joke on his Instagram.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">In 2014, McDowell started a joke on his Instagram grid that still lives on today. He posted a photo of Andie MacDowell (not his mom) with the message, "31 years ago this woman gave birth to me."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">His sister Lilly even joined in the joke: "I love when mom wears her hair like this."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-0 et3p2gv0"><strong>Seriously, he had me fooled for a while there:</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">On Mother's Day last year, Steenburgen posted a video of her son calling Andie for Mother's Day. She revealed in the post that her 37-year-old son calls the actress every Mother's Day, but she takes it in stride: "Love to you, Andie from me and love to you my son, who never fails to make me laugh," she wrote. "😘😂🌺."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">MacDowell is the mother of actress Margaret Qualley and her siblings Rainey and Justin. But she seems to accept Charlie as her honorary son, too. <strong></strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=52 class="css-0 et3p2gv0"><strong>Besides the now seven-year-old Andie MacDowell joke, McDowell likes to take a silly photo:</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=56 class="css-0 et3p2gv0"><strong>And he really loves to troll his mom:</strong></p><h2 data-node-id=58 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">He's an uncle.<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=59 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">He posts a lot of adorable photos with the kiddos in his life:</p><h2 data-node-id=63 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">He's a dog dad.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=64 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">There are a lot of sweet moments on his Instagram of the dogs in his life, too:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=67 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">In 2019, he introduced his friends and followers to his dog, Redford. He wrote a message to his late dog Marvin (pictured above): "Marvin, if you can hear me, I miss you every waking moment. You will never be replaced. And as I write this and tears stream down my face, Redford is licking them away, which I think you would approve of. ❤️"</p><h2 data-node-id=71 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">And a surfer.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=72 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">At the end of 2020 he made this joke alongside a wipeout surfing photo: "Goodbye 2020. You didn't feel good."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=74 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">"But damn, you made it look good regardless," Collins responded. "Can't wait to party wave with you in 2021 💙."</p><h2 data-node-id=78 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">He's dated Kristin Chenoweth, Rooney Mara, and Emilia Clarke</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=79 class="body-text css-0 et3p2gv0">McDowell has a lot of famous exes. In 2008, McDowell dated his mom's Four Christmases <u>(</u>2008) co-star. "We met on set," <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/celebrity/kristin-chenoweths-new-boyfriend-her-costars-son/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he told People then" class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">he told People then</a>.

One year and month later, they were engaged.</p><h2 data-node-id=81 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">Collins said being married to McDowell makes her feel “old.”</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=82 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">In an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nylon.com/entertainment/lily-collins-emily-in-paris-season-2-married-wedding-planning data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Nylon class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">Nylon</a> in 2021, Collins said of their transition to marriage, “It's so nice to be able to finally say that I'm a wife, [but] sometimes it makes me feel very old.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=83 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">But in October of 2022, she told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eonline.com/news/1349644/what-lily-collins-learned-after-one-year-of-marriage-to-charlie-mcdowell data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="E!
