However, he changed his plans after he began his relationship with one of the most popular TikTok stars, Kristen Hancher. Kisten’s fame and popularity helped Andrew a lot to gain recognition. Later on, he eventually followed in her footsteps and started his career out of social media.</p><p>Andrew Gregory very much liked the idea of fans and supporters approaching for autographs and pictures. There was one time when he was with Kristen, and a little girl who was battling cancer approached them for a selfie. Andrew was truly and deeply moved by this action. These kinds of factors helped him in making the all-important career decision. And then, he started posting videos on TikTok.</p><p>Andrew Gregory started off his career on social media by collaborating with Kristen. Initially, they came up with dance and lip-sync videos. Eventually, his account gradually became popular and gained prominence as an internet celebrity. He then later started sharing solo videos on his Instagram account. That was the time when his video-making skills were put to the test as his videos were not featuring any other famous TikTok and social media stars.</p><p>However, Andrew managed to gain fans and followers by sharing a variety of videos like comedy, dance, rap, and lip-sync videos. His favorite TikTok star is Cash Noguchi. He considers Noguchi as his inspiration. Likewise, Instagram played a very important role in making him gain the limelight. Then, apart from posting videos, Andrew also started sharing his pictures, and often those pictures were clicked along with Kristen. Even though those pictures were against Instagram policies, they kept sharing intimate and objectionable photographs. Moreover, Andrew is very much into Instagram and enjoys checking the number of likes on his photographs</p><h4>More About Career…</h4><p>Moreover, Kristen was once streaming a live video when suddenly she got into an argument with Andrew. The fight was heating up real soon. However, the couple was making up for each other’s mistakes after a while. But they eventually got intimate. Unfortunately, Kristen left her camera on and was unaware of it. And because of that, their whole intimate scene was live-streamed. When the video went viral all over the internet, they had to face a lot of embarrassment and several hate comments. However, the situation came under control after a while. But, this controversy also turned Andrew into a major internet celebrity.</p><p>Andrew also appeared in a couple of videos that were posted on Kristen’s YouTube channel. The couple has appeared in several challenge videos, tags, and question-answer videos. All of their videos together have decent viewership.</p><p>Further, Andrew Gregory has starred in a web series titled “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Attaway Appeal</a>“, which was created under “One Push Productions”.
