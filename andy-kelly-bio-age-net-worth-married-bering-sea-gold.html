Like his brother, younger Kelly is The Reaper’s resident gold hound and he is also responsible for the bulk of the gold recovered by the family so far.</p><p>Now, in this ‘Andy Kelly Bio’ let us tell you all about his personal as well as professional endeavors.</p><h3><strong>Andy Kelly On Bering Sea Gold</strong></h3><p>Andy Kelly as they say on&nbsp;Bering Sea Gold&nbsp;is the muscle of the Kelly clan.</p><p>So far, Andy has been on in some 106 episodes of Bering Sea Gold between 2013 and 2023, 6 episodes of Bering Sea Gold: Under the Ice in 2014, and just in an episode of Gold Rush: The Dirt. And no.</p><p>In these gold mining series, besides the mining, there also has been a whole load of drama. And one of these also famously involved Andy. In the more recent (January 2023) episode “Brawl of Duty” viewers saw things get physical between Andy and Shawn Pomrenke as what first started as an argument escalated resulting in some fist fight.</p><p>So, Andy’s family contributed to the controversy of such kind time and time again.</p><p>Viewers also have seen Andy and his brother bicker like the best of them, enough times. Of course, Andy also has regularly butted heads with his father. In fact, both brothers occasionally have had issues with their dad. A while ago, the latter took nearly $13,000 worth of gold from his sons. When confronted, he justified his actions by saying that he set up the boys with their mining careers.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Andy Kelly’s Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Andy Kelly, working alongside his father and his brother, Kris, reportedly accumulated $100,000 as his net worth (as per Cinemaholic).</p><p>While his father is one of the wealthiest cast members of the show reportedly standing at more than $2.2 million, Andy and his brother have a long way to go before they meet the standard their father has set.</p><p>Meanwhile, Shawn, who Andy just clashed with, was reportedly considered the richest of all the&nbsp;Bering Sea Gold&nbsp;cast members.</p><p>Shawn who too is a regular face on the series is best known for operating Christine Rose. He is the son of Steve Pomrenke.</p><h3><strong>Is Andy Kelly Married?</strong></h3><p>Just like his brother Andy Kelly has always been very private about his dating life mostly. Despite his family’s drama unfolding on the show, this one aspect of his life has remained an exception.</p><p>He seems to have put much effort to ensure that his life with his partner precisely stays undocumented. Also, it does not help that he even chose to not be on social media. So, at the time of this writing, there was no information about his partner, i.e., if he has one.</p><h3><strong>Andy Kelly Age</strong></h3><p>Andy was born Andrew Joseph Kelly at Los Alamitos Hospital at 5 am one fine day when the year was 1982. So, he reached the age of 40 in 2022.</p><p>His brother, on the other hand, was born a few years back in early 1980.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Andy Kelly’s Parents?</strong></h3><p>Kris Kelly’s dad Bradley “Brad” J kelly turned 60 years old on 1 March 2022. It was he who brought his sons to Nome years ago to follow his dreams of getting rich quickly.</p><p>The world was first introduced to the Kellys when the patriarch of the clan made his way onto the show during season 2, in 2012. Then, they got to know his two sons, Andy and Kris, and their mom (Brad’s wife) Wendy.</p><p>Fans also noticed Wendy and Brad’s feud which is believed to have lasted well over 30 years. Then, there entered the baby mama, Courtney. It was to help her and their newly born that Brad had stolen money from his own sons souring their relationship. Also, in a separate scandal, in February 2022, Brad also beat up a woman with whom he shares a child. This should be Courtney.</p><p>About Andy’s mother Wendy Sue Kelly: she turned 61 years old in April 2022 and had been residing in Keaau, Hawaii following her split with Brad.</p><p>About her sons, the matriarch said she is really proud of them, “the Kelly Boys” on Discovery Channel’s Bering Sea Gold“.</p><p>You should also know that back in 2021, there were rumors about a death in the Kelly family. But, this does not appear to be the case.</p><h3><strong>Andy Kelly Height</strong></h3><p>Andy Kelly stands above 6’1” in height, making him just an inch shorter than his brother.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Andy Kelly From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Andy Kelly hails from Hawaii.
