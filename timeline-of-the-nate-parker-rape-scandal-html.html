of Nate Parker is being relitigated in public. While attending Penn State in the late 1990s, Parker and his wrestling teammate Jean Celestin were accused of raping a female student. Parker was found not guilty, while Celestin was found guilty, only to have his conviction overturned. Though the case has been a matter of public record for over a decade, it has only recently entered the spotlight thanks to Parker’s increased profile: He wrote, directed, and stars in the Nat Turner biopic <a href=#><i>The Birth of a Nation</i></a>, which set a sales record at Sundance and figured to be a major player in this year’s Oscar race. (Celestin shares a “story by” credit on the movie.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-3c1430c59e0f784d5f68997174d10f16-2-0-1@published data-word-count=81>After the news that <a href=#>the woman in the case committed suicide</a> in 2012, Parker’s film is <a href=#>spurring debates</a>&nbsp;about the divide between art and artist, while the man himself has embarked on a last-minute PR campaign to respond to the controversy in the lead up to the film’s release later this week.

And then awake again and … somebody just on top of me other than Nate.”&nbsp;In his statement to police, Celestin claims that Doe pulled him by the hand into Parker’s room, began having sex with Parker, and gestured for him to join.
